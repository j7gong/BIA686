TI The macrophage-biomaterial interface: a proteomic analysis of the
   conditioned medium environment
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB well as extracellular microenvironments. However, proteomics has not been extensively applied to examine cell-material interface dynamics or the conditioned medium (CM) that ensues. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) are of particular interest as they are the predominant cell type contributing to chronic inflammation at long-term implant sites. The current study compares the CM generated when MDM were adherent to tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) or a model polycarbonate-urethane (PCNU). Two-dimensional electrophoresis and either matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography Fourier transform mass spectrometry were used for protein identification to begin to assess how the CM is altered when MDM are in contact with a degradable PCNU material relative to a typical tissue culture surface.
   RESULTS: Proteomic analysis of CM samples identified regulatory molecules associated with specific activation pathways, such as interferon-gamma, and degradative proteins, such as matrix metalloproteinases and chitinase-like proteins, suggesting their involvement in the MDM response to PCNU materials. Furthermore, this study illustrates the challenges in analysing CM protein profiles against a background of intracellular protein, originating from lysed cells or cell fragments, and cell culture additives such as fetal bovine serum.
   CONCLUSIONS: The microenvironment surrounding an MDM-biomaterial interface is complex, containing proteins that relate to intracellular signalling pathways, cytoskeletal remodelling, degradation as well as the presence of serum factors necessary for cell attachment. The use of proteomics to determine the CM protein profile should continue to aid in the elucidation of cell-material interactions. (c) 2008 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI Modeling of the flow rate in the dispensing-based process for
   fabricating tissue scaffolds
SO JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
AB Made from biomaterials,tissue scaffolds are three-dimensional (3D) constructs with highly interconnected pore networks for facilitating cell growth and flow transport of nutrients and metabolic waste. To fabricate the scaffolds with complex structures, dispensing-based rapid prototyping technique has been employed recently. In such a fabrication process, the flow rate of biomaterial dispensed is of importance since it directly contributes to the pore size and porosity of the scaffold fabricated. However the modeling of the flow rate has proven to be a challenging task due to its complexity. This paper presents the development of a model for the flow rate in the scaffold fabrication process based on the fundamentals of fluid mechanics. To verify the effectiveness of the developed model, experiments were carried out, in which the chitosan solution (2% w/v) in acetic acid was used for dispensing under different applied pressures (50 kPa, 100 kPa, 150 kPa, 200 kPa, and 250 kPa) and needle heater temperatures (25 degrees C, 35 degrees C, 50 degrees C, and 65 degrees C). The measured flow rates were used to identify the flow behavior of the solution and were compared to the predictions from the developed model to illustrate the model effectiveness. Based on the developed model, simulations were carried out to identify the effects of the needle size and the flow behavior on the flow rate in the scaffold fabrication process. The developed model was also applied to determine the dispensing conditions for fabricating 3D scaffoldsfrom a 50% chitosan-hydroxyapatite colloidal gel. As an example, a scaffold fabricated with a well-controlled internal structure of diameters of 610 +/- 43 mu m and pore sizes of 850 +/- 75 mu m in the horizontal plane and of 430 +/- 50 mu m in the vertical direction is presented in this paper to illustrate the promise of the developed model as applied to the 3D scaffold fabrication.

TI Study of impact-induced mechanical effects in cell direct writing using
   smooth particle hydrodynamic method
SO JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
AB Biomaterial direct-write technologies have been receiving more and more attention as rapid prototyping innovations in the area of tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and biosensor/actuator fabrication based on computer-aided designs. However cell damage due to the mechanical impact during cell direct writing has been observed and is a possible hurdle for broad applications of fragile cell direct writing. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact-induced cell mechanical loading profile in cell landing in terms of stress, acceleration, and maximum shear strain component during cell direct writing using a mesh-free smooth particle hydrodynamic method. Such cell mechanical loading profile information can be used to understand and predict possible impact-induced cell damage. It is found that the cell membrane usually undergoes a relatively severe deformation and the cell mechanical loading profile is dependent on the cell droplet initial velocity and the substrate coating thickness. Two important impact processes may occur during cell direct writing: the first impact between the cell droplet and the substrate coating and the second impact between the cell and the substrate. It is concluded that the impact-induced cell damage depends not only on the magnitudes of stress, acceleration, and/or shear strain but also the loading history that a cell experiences.

AB Nanocomposites consisting of hydroxyapatite (HA) and a sodium maleate copolymer (maleic polyelectrolyte), synthesized by hydrothermal method and deposited on titanium substrates by Matrix Assisted Pulsed Laser Evaporation (MAPLE) technique were tested for the biological properties. Coating bioanalysis was carried out by triple staining of actin, microtubules and nuclei followed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Within 24 h cells that occupied the biomaterial surface displayed the morphology and cytoskeleton pattern similar to the controls. Cells grown on nanocomposite coated surfaces had a higher proliferation rate than their counterparts grown on Ti coated with HA alone, indicating that maleic polyelectrolyte improved surface bio-adhesive characteristics. The capacity to induce cell attachment, spreading and proliferation demonstrated the potential of Ti coated with HA-polymer nanocomposites to be used as scaffolds in dental or orthopedic implantology.

TI A novel enzymatically-mediated drug delivery carrier for bone tissue
   engineering applications: combining biodegradable starch-based
   microparticles and differentiation agents
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
CT 21st European Conference on Biomaterials
CY SEP 09-13, 2007
CL Brighton, ENGLAND
AB In many biomedical applications, the performance of biomaterials depends largely on their degradation behavior. For instance, in drug delivery applications, the polymeric carrier should degrade under physiological conditions slowly releasing the encapsulated drug. The aim of this work was, therefore, to develop an enzymatic-mediated degradation carrier system for the delivery of differentiation agents to be used in bone tissue engineering applications. For that, a polymeric blend of starch with polycaprolactone (SPCL) was used to produce a microparticle carrier for the controlled release of dexamethasone (DEX). In order to investigate the effect of enzymes on the degradation behavior of the developed system and release profile of the encapsulated osteogenic agent (DEX), the microparticles were incubated in phosphate buffer solution in the presence of alpha-amylase and/or lipase enzymes (at physiological concentrations), at 37 degrees C for different periods of time. The degradation was followed by gravimetric measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and the release of DEX was monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The developed microparticles were shown to be susceptible to enzymatic degradation, as observed by an increase in weight loss and porosity with degradation time when compared with control samples (incubation in buffer only). For longer degradation times, the diameter of the microparticles decreased significantly and a highly porous matrix was obtained. The in vitro release studies showed a sustained release pattern with 48% of the encapsulated drug being released for a period of 30 days. As the degradation proceeds, it is expected that the remaining encapsulated drug will be completely released as a consequence of an increasingly permeable matrix and faster diffusion of the drug. Cytocompatibility results indicated the possibility of the developed microparticles to be used as biomaterial due to their reduced cytotoxic effects.

TI Sterilization effects on starPEG coated polymer surfaces:
   characterization and cell viability
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
CT 21st European Conference on Biomaterials
CY SEP 09-13, 2007
CL Brighton, ENGLAND
AB Sterilization is frequently an issue for polymeric biomaterials including hydrogels, where autoclaving needs to be discarded, and gamma-irradiation and low temperature hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilization are already important alternatives. Coatings based on poly(ethylene glycol) are a well-known strategy to reduce unspecific protein interactions on biomaterial surfaces. Dense, ultrathin coatings of isocyanate terminated star-shaped poly(ethylene glycol) (starPEG) molecules have proven to be resistant to unspecific adsorption of proteins and enable direct biofunctionalization. The effectivity and stability of the starPEG coatings on poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) were studied after gamma-irradiation (normed dosis 25 kGy) and plasma sterilization (Sterrad 100S). The selected surface properties determined were: surface composition (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS), wettability (sessile drop contact angle) and protein adsorption by fluorescence microscopy (Avidin-TexasRed, Bovine Serum Albumin-Rhodamin). Preliminary cell experiments with the cell line L929 were performed prior and after sterilization to investigate the cell repellence of the starPEG coatings as well as cell viability and specific cell adhesion on GRGDS-modified coatings. The starPEG coating undergoes a slight oxidation due to plasma and gamma-sterilization; this represents a minor variation confirmed by XPS and contact angle results. The non-sterilized starPEG and the plasma-sterilized coatings are protein repellent, however the protein adsorption on starPEG coated substrates is much stronger after gamma-sterilization for both avidin and bovine serum albumin. The cell experiments indicate that the starPEG coatings are appliable homogeneously by incubation and are non-cell adherent. Moreover, after both sterilization processes the starPEG coatings remain cell repellent and the GRGDS-modified coatings presented vital cells. Thus we conclude that the plasma sterilization is more convenient for the starPEG coatings and GRGDS-modified starPEG coatings.

TI Characterization of collagen II fibrils containing biglycan and their
   effect as a coating on osteoblast adhesion and proliferation
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
CT 21st European Conference on Biomaterials
CY SEP 09-13, 2007
CL Brighton, ENGLAND
AB Collagen has been used as a coating material for titanium-based implants for bone contact and as a component of scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. In general collagen type I has been used, however very little attention has been focussed on collagen type II. Collagen-based coatings and scaffolds have been enhanced by the incorporation of the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulphate (CS), however the proteglycan biglycan, which is found in bone and contains glycosaminoglycan chains consisting of CS, has not been used as a biomaterial component. The study had the following aims: firstly, five different collagen II preparations were compared with regard to their ability to bind CS and biglycan and the changes in fibril morphology thereby induced. Secondly, the effects of biglycan on the adhesion of primary rat osteoblasts (rO) as well as the proliferation of rO, primary human osteoblasts (hO) and the osteoblast-like cell line 7F2 were studied by culturing the cells on surfaces coated with collagen II fibrils containing biglycan. Fibrils of the collagen II preparation which bound the most biglycan were used to coat titanium surfaces. Bare titanium, titanium coated with collagen II fibrils and titanium coated with collagen II fibrils containing biglycan were compared. It was found that different collagen II preparations showed different affinities for CS and biglycan. In four of the five preparations tested, biglycan reduced fibril diameter, however the ability of a preparation to bind more biglycan did not appear to lead to a greater reduction in fibril diameter. Fibrils containing biglycan promoted the formation of focal adhesions by rO and significantly enhanced the proliferation of hO but not of rO or 7F2 cells. These results should encourage further investigation of biglycan as a component of collagen-based scaffolds and/or coatings.

TI Hydrogel-elastomer composite biomaterials: 4. Experimental optimization
   of hydrogel-elastomer composite fibers for use as a wound dressing
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
CT 21st European Conference on Biomaterials
CY SEP 09-13, 2007
CL Brighton, ENGLAND
AB We report a novel 3-D cavity wound dressing based on a hydrogel-elastomer Interpenetrating Polymer Network (IPN) fabricated into an open-mesh architecture. IPN fibers used to form the dressing were produced by a wet spinning method and optimized in two steps. A factorial experiment was first conducted to identify key parameters that controlled fiber properties. We observed that gelatin wt% played a major role in determining fiber yield, swelling, strength and stability. Other contributing factors included coagulation solution composition, gelatin type, and pre- and post-UV irradiation time. The key factors were then further evaluated individually to achieve a condition that provided a combination of good swelling, mechanical properties and stability. The concentration of the gelatin/HydroThane (TM) extrusion solution significantly affected fiber formation and properties, presumably due to the changes in solution viscosity. The effects of pre-UV irradiation were also ascribed to its impact on the solution viscosity and became negligible at higher concentrations when viscosity is mainly controlled by concentration. The composition of the coagulation bath influenced the fiber swelling and wet stress. These results, taken together with our previous studies, suggest that our biomaterial would provide a combination of mechanical and swelling properties suitable for wound dressing applications.

TI DNA ligation of ultramicro volume using an EWOD microfluidic system with
   coplanar electrodes
SO JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING
AB An automatic ultramicro-volume DNA ligation process using a coplanar electrode type of electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) microfluidic system was designed for economy of reagent. The droplets, containing DNA, a ligation enzyme and a multi-salt reaction buffer, served to complete the ligation using a developed EWOD system. Droplets of ultramicro volume (0.3 mu L) were successfully generated from reservoirs between one plate with coplanar electrodes and another plate with a hydrophobic surface free of electrodes. In one successful cloning, the total usage of reagents in an ultramicro-volume EWOD chip was 2.1 mu L; no volume was wasted, in comparison with 85% waste with the standard protocol and 80% waste with a free-cover coplanar EWOD chip. The results also show that the entire process was accomplished without damage to the chip surface and without biomaterial annulment. With a design consisting of electrode pathways in a flexible pattern and multiplex reservoirs, an EWOD digital microfluidic system with coplanar electrodes would be improved as an efficient parallel DNA-cloning system in the construction of an artificial library or expression library.

TI Randomized comparative study between buccal mucosal and acellular
   bladder matrix grafts in complex anterior urethral strictures
SO JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
AB Purpose: Urethral strictures have been a reconstructive dilemma for many years due to the limited availability of tissue substitutes and incidence of recurrence. Buccal mucosal grafts have been a favored material in instances where penile skin is unavailable due to its durability and excellent graft survival. Recently collagen based matrices derived from the bladder have been used successfully in patients with stricture disease and hypospadias. We performed a randomized comparative study to assess the outcome of the acellular bladder matrix compared to buccal mucosa in patients with complex urethral strictures.
   Materials and Methods: Human demineralized bone matrix, obtained from cadaveric donors, was processed and prepared for use as an off-the-shelf material. Thirty patients with stricture 21 to 59 years old (mean 36.2) were enrolled and assessed using a standard protocol. The stricture length ranged from 2 to 18 cm (mean 6.9), of which 11 patients had bulbar, 7 had pendulous and 12 had combined bulbopendulous strictures. Of the 30 patients 7 had received no previous intervention while the remaining 23 had undergone 1 to 7 procedures (mean 1.9). All patients were randomized and alternatively assigned to receive either buccal mucosa or demineralized bone matrix and underwent an onlay procedure.
   Results: All patients except 2 who were lost during followup were followed for 18 to 36 months (mean 25). In patients with a healthy urethral bed (less than 2 prior operations) the success rate of buccal mucosa grafts (10 of 10) was similar to the bladder matrix grafts (8 of 9) in terms of patency. In patients with an unhealthy urethral bed (more than 2 prior operations) only 2 of 6 patients with a bladder matrix graft were successful, whereas all 5 patients with a buccal mucosa graft had a patent urethra. Postoperative uroflowmetry showed significant voiding improvement in both groups. Histology of the graft biopsies showed normal urethral tissue characteristics.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the use of acellular bladder matrix is a viable option for urethral repair. Demineralized bone matrix as an off-the-shelf biomaterial achieves the best results in patients with a healthy urethral bed, no spongiofibrosis and good urethral mucosa.

AB Ti-XNb-10Ta-5Zr (mass %) alloys based on nominal compositions of Ti-35Nb-IM-5Zr,Ti-30Nb-10Ta-5Zr, and Ti-25Nb-10Ta-5Zr were fabricated through powder metallurgy and forging and swaging processes for biomedical applications. The tensile deformation mechanisms of the Ti-25Nb-10Ta-5Zr, Ti-30Nb-10Ta-5Zr, and Ti-35Nb-10Ta-5Zr alloys were investigated in situ by X-ray diffraction analysis under several loading conditions.
   Under the loading conditions, the X-ray diffraction peaks of all the specimens shifted to higher angles than those obtained under the unloading conditions. For the Ti-30Nb-10Ta-5Zr alloy, the elastic deformation is considered to progress continuously in a different crystal direction although after the elastic strain reaches elastic limit in the crystal direction where the elastic limit is the smallest, slip deformation occurs in that crystal direction. The elastic modulus of this alloy appears to decrease in terms of strain over the proportional limit. Thus, the elastic deformation behavior of the Ti-30Nb-10Ta-5Zr alloy does not obey Hooke's law.

TI Hierarchical fibre composite structure and micromechanical properties of
   phosphatic and calcitic brachiopod shell biomaterials - an overview
SO MINERALOGICAL MAGAZINE
AB Brachiopods are a phylum of shell-forming sessile marine invertebrates which have existed since the early Cambrian. Two very different biomaterial design strategies for their shells evolved early in their history. Both strategies use hybrid fibre composites, however, one is based oil mineral fibres embedded in similar to 2 wt.% of organic biopolymer sheaths and the inorganic fibres are calcite single crystals. In the second strategy the fibres are biopolymers and are reinforced with Ca-phosphate nanoparticles to form a fibrous nanocomposite. Here the organic component (chitin) dominates. The Ca-phosphate nanoparticle-reinforcement strategy is not unlike that in vertebrate hone, however, the microscale Structure is laminated with alternating laminae which have a different degree of mineralization. The calcitic shells feature all outer compact layer of calcite micro- and nanoparticles protecting the inner fibrous layer from the outside. Transmission electron microscopy of the fibrous layer reveals intercrystalline and intracrystalline biopolymers. The calcitic shell material is stiff with nano-indentation E-moduli of 63 +/- 8 GPa and relatively hard (Vickers microhardness up to 400 HV 0.0005/10 and nanohardness 4 +/- 0.5 GPa). Compared to inorganic calcite the microhardness is doubled and the nanohardness increases by 60%. We attribute this increased hardness to intracrystalline biopolymers. The nano-indentation E-moduli of the chitinophosphatic shells range from 3 to 55 GPa as a result Of the varying degree of mineralization between their laminae, and similarly their nanohardness varies between 0.1 and 3 GPa. For brachiopods burrowing inside the sediment, the alternation of non-mineralized laminae with thin, more strongly mineralized laminae provides abrasion-resistance. hardness and longitudinal stiffness while it preserves the flexibility provided by the organic component for bending movements.

SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB Ultraviolet (UV) fluorescent lamps are widely used in the manufacturing process of biomaterials. The possibility of replacing these lamps with ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) was investigated and the results are presented here. A number of emission characteristics, including the spectral output and intensity of both light sources were measured and compared. The warm up time of the UV-LED was found to be faster than that of the fluorescent lamp while their stabilities were found to be comparable. The ability of each source to initiate photopolymerisation in a biomaterial sample was monitored using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and the percentage polymerisation calculated. The results presented here show that UV-LEDs are a viable alternative to UV fluorescent lamps in the manufacturing process of biomaterials. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Spontaneous tooth eruption after alveolar cleft osteoplasty using
   tissue-engineered bone: a case report
SO ORAL SURGERY ORAL MEDICINE ORAL PATHOLOGY ORAL RADIOLOGY AND
   ENDODONTOLOGY
AB To bridge the cleft in the alveolar bone and to allow for physiologic eruption of the canine teeth, alveolar bone grafting is often necessary in patients with cleft lips and palates. Instead of autogenous bone, biomaterial seeded with autogenous osteogenic cells has found some clinical application. However, so far no real functional proof has been available to demonstrate that this technique also allows further physiologic features such as tooth eruption to occur. This report describes the results of grafting tissue-engineered bone into the alveolar cleft of a 10-year-old boy. Immediate postoperative healing was uneventful. Eight months after grafting, erupting teeth had moved into the newly formed bone. Eighteen months postoperatively at the site where the tissue-engineered graft had been inserted, the canine had erupted spontaneously in its proper place. The data suggest that tissue-engineered bone can lead to the ossification of the alveolar cleft and allow for physiologic spontaneous tooth eruption.

TI Synthesis of hydroxyapatite/poly(vinyl alcohol phosphate) nanocomposite
   and its characterization
SO POLYMER COMPOSITES
AB Hydroxyapatite (HAp)/poly(vinyl alcohol phosphate) (PVAP) nanocomposite has been prepared using a solution-based method varying HAp from 10 to 60% (w/ w). X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared absorption spectra (FTIR), and thermal analysis have indicated the presence of bonding between HAp particles and PVAP matrix. Transmission electron microscope analysis shows the needle-like crystals of HAp powder having a diameter of 6-10 nm and a length of 26-38 nm. The surface roughness and the homogeneous dispersion of HAP particles in the polymer matrix have been observed by scanning electron microscopy. Particle size distribution analysis shows the narrow distribution of hydrodynamic particles in the polymer matrix. The tensile stress-strain curves show the improvement in mechanical properties of the composites with increase in amount of HAP particles loading. The composites along with polymer are highly hemocompatible. The use of PVAP promotes the homogeneous distribution of particles on the polymer matrix along with strong particle-polymer interfacial bonding, which has supported the improvement in mechanical properties of the composites. The prepared HAp/PVAP composite with uniform microstructure would be effective to act as a potential biomaterial.

TI Foreign body reaction to biomaterials
SO SEMINARS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB The foreign body reaction composed of macrophages and foreign body giant cells is the end-stage response of the inflammatory and wound healing responses following implantation of a medical device, prosthesis, or biomaterial. A brief, focused overview of events leading to the foreign body reaction is presented. The major focus of this review is on factors that modulate the interaction of macrophages and foreign body giant cells on synthetic surfaces where the chemical, physical, and morphological characteristics of the synthetic surface are considered to play a role in modulating cellular events. These events in the foreign body reaction include protein adsorption, monocyte/macrophage adhesion, macrophage fusion to form foreign body giant cells, consequences of the foreign body response on biomaterials, and cross-talk between macrophages/foreign body giant cells and inflammatory/wound healing cells. Biomaterial surface properties play an important role in modulating the foreign body reaction in the first two to four weeks following implantation of a medical device, even though the foreign body reaction at the tissue/material interface is present for the in vivo lifetime of the medical device. An understanding of the foreign body reaction is important as the foreign body reaction may impact the biocompatibility (safety) of the medical device, prosthesis, or implanted biomaterial and may significantly impact shortand long-term tissue responses with tissue-engineered constructs containing proteins, cells, and other biological components for use in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Our perspective has been on the inflammatory and wound healing response to implanted materials, devices, and tissue-engineered constructs. The incorporation of biological components of allogeneic or xenogeneic origin as well as stem cells into tissue-engineered or regenerative approaches opens up a myriad of other challenges. An in depth understanding of how the immune system interacts with these cells and how biomaterials or tissue-engineered constructs influence these interactions may prove pivotal to the safety, biocompatibility, and function of the device or system under consideration.

TI Effects of biomaterial-induced inflammation on fibrosis and rejection
SO SEMINARS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB Evidence is emerging that biomaterials cause inflammation by ligating innate immune receptors on antigen presenting cells. Although inflammation is usually viewed as detrimental, it has unexpected and potentially beneficial effects on fibrosis and transplant rejection. For example, the magnitude of inflammation due to a biomaterial is not predictive of the extent of fibrosis. Similarly, biomaterials do not always show adjuvancy. Some biomaterials suppressed T cell rejection responses in vivo and in vitro, while others non-specifically stimulated T cell proliferation. Understanding these complex inter-relationships is the key to designing a biomaterial that stimulates regeneration and induces tolerance in tissue engineering applications. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Lymphatic drainage function and its immunological implications: From
   dendritic cell homing to vaccine design
SO SEMINARS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB The slow interstitial flow that drains fluid from the blood capillaries into the lymphatic capillaries provides transport of macromolecular nutrients to cells in the interstitium. We discuss herein how this flow also provides continuous access to immune cells residing in the lymph nodes of antigens from self or from pathogens residing in the interstitium. We also address mechanisms by which dendritic cells in the periphery sense interstitial flow to home efficiently into the lymphatics after activation, and how lymphatic endothelium can be activated by this flow, including how it can act as a lymphatic morphoregulator. Further, we present concepts on how interstitial flow can be exploited with biomaterial systems to deliver antigen and adjuvant molecules directly into the lymphatics, to target dendritic cells residing in the lymph nodes rather than in the peripheral tissues., using particles that are small enough to be carried along by flow through the network structure of the interstitium. Finally, we present recent work on lymphatic and lymphoid tissue engineering, including how interstitial flow can be used as a design principle. Thus, an understanding of the physiological processes that govern transport in the interstitium guides new understanding of both immune cell interactions with the lymphatics as well as therapeutic interventions exploiting the lymphatics as a target.

TI Biocompatibility and potential of acellular human amniotic membrane to
   support the attachment and proliferation of allogeneic cells
SO TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A
AB The aim of this study was to determine the biocompatibility of an acellular human amniotic membrane biomaterial, which may have clinical utility for cell delivery. Human amniotic membrane was decellularized using 0.03% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), with hypotonic tris buffer and protease inhibitors and nuclease treatment. The membrane was terminally sterilized using an optimal concentration of peracetic acid. Residual SDS present within the acellular membrane was quantified using radio-labeled C 14 SDS. In vivo biocompatibility was assessed by implantation of acellular human amniotic membrane subcutaneously into mice for 3 months and comparison with fresh and glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue. Cellular infiltrate into the explanted tissues was characterized using monoclonal antibodies against the following cell surface markers: CD3, CD4, CD34, and F4/80. Calcification was determined using the Von Kossa's stain. The potential of acellular human amniotic membrane to support the attachment and proliferation, and maintain viability of primary human dermal fibroblasts and primary human dermal keratinocytes was assessed in vitro, using a static culture system. Peracetic acid at a concentration of 0.1% (v/v) was sufficient for the sterilization of acellular amniotic membrane. Levels of SDS present within the acellular tissue were 0.62 +/- 0.13 mu g/mg. Analysis of explanted samples from the mice indicated that acellular amniotic membrane contained low numbers of T-cells and high numbers of fibroblastic cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells, indicative of a wound-healing response. There was no evidence of calcification present within explanted acellular amniotic membrane compared to explanted glutaraldehyde-fixed amniotic membrane. Acellular amniotic membrane was shown to be capable of supporting the attachment and proliferation of primary human fibroblasts and keratinocytes. The viability of the cells was maintained for up to 4 weeks. Cell-seeded acellular amniotic membrane has the potential for delivering autologous or allogeneic cells to treat a variety of conditions, including diabetic foot ulcers, corneal defects, and severe skin burns.

TI Engineering custom-designed osteochondral tissue grafts
SO TRENDS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Tissue engineering is expected to help us outlive the failure of our organs by enabling the creation of tissue substitutes capable of fully restoring the original tissue function. Degenerative joint disease, which affects one-fifth of the US population and is the country's leading cause of disability, drives current research of actively growing, functional tissue grafts for joint repair. Toward this goal, living cells are used in conjunction with biomaterial scaffolds (serving as instructive templates for tissue development) and bioreactors; (providing environmental control and molecular and physical regulatory signals). In this review, we discuss the requirements for engineering customized, anatomically-shaped, stratified grafts for joint repair and the challenges of designing these grafts to provide immediate functionality (load bearing, structural support) and long-term regeneration (maturation, integration, remodeling).

TI Friction coefficient measurement of hydrogel materials on living

SO TRIBOLOGY LETTERS
AB Soft biomaterials are often used in applications that involve contact and relative motion against biological tissues, as well as complicated and variable environments. The friction coefficient of these contacts involving living human cells is of key importance in the analysis and success of these devices. This work measures the contacting friction coefficient between soft hydrogel biomaterial surfaces against live human corneal epithelial cells using a custom micro-tribometer. The friction coefficients were of the order of mu = 0.03 for contacts that did not cause gross destruction of the cell layer. Damage to the confluent cell layer was assessed using a Trypan blue stain with optical microscopy. This damage was quantified statistically using image-processing software. The damage was also correlated to in situ friction measurements, with the lowest friction values seen on undamaged cells and higher friction on damaged regions.

TI A seed and feed model for the formation of Candida albicans biofilms
   under flow conditions using an improved modified Robbins device
SO REVISTA IBEROAMERICANA DE MICOLOGIA
AB A variety of manifestations of Candida albicans infections are associated with the formation of biofilms on the surface of biomaterials. In order to maintain their niche these adherent populations need to withstand the continuous bathing action of physiological fluids (saliva, blood), which also provide water and nutrients to the fungal cells. Thus, it was the aim of this study to examine and further characterize the development of C. albicans biofilms under shear forces and a flow of replenishing nutrients, emulating the conditions that fungal cells would normally encounter within the host. An improved modified Robbins device (MRD) was designed to hold six poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) plugs of 25 mm in diameter. A "seed and feed" model of biofilm formation was then implemented for which the apparatus was initially seeded with a C. albicans cell suspension to allow initial adhesion of fungal cells to the biomaterial. Following this initial step, sterile medium was then pumped through the MRD at a constant flow rate. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) demonstrated a high degree of heterogeneity associated with the structure of biofilms formed under flowing conditions using the MRD. In addition, these biofilms displayed a complex three dimensional architecture and increased production of exopolymeric material.

TI Immunization by a bacterial aerosol
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB By manufacturing a single-particle system in two particulate forms (i.e., micrometer size and nanometer size), we have designed a bacterial vaccine form that exhibits improved efficacy of immunization. Microstructural properties are adapted to alter dispersive and aerosol properties independently. Dried "nanomicroparticie" vaccines possess two axes of nanoscale dimensions and a third axis of micrometer dimension; the last one permits effective micrometer-like physical dispersion, and the former provides alignment of the principal nanodimension particle axes with the direction of airflow. Particles formed with this combination of nano- and micrometer-scale dimensions possess a greater ability to aerosolize than particles of standard spherical isotropic shape and of similar geometric diameter. Here, we demonstrate effective application of this biomaterial by using the live attenuated tuberculosis vaccine bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Prepared as a spray-dried nanomicroparticle aerosol, BCG vaccine exhibited high-efficiency delivery and peripheral lung targeting capacity from a low-cost and technically simple delivery system. Aerosol delivery of the BCG nanomicroparticle to normal guinea pigs subsequently challenged with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis significantly reduced bacterial burden and lung pathology both relative to untreated animals and to control animals immunized with the standard parenteral BCG.

TI Effect of injectable alginate implant on cardiac remodeling and function
   after recent and old infarcts in rat
SO CIRCULATION
AB Background-Adverse cardiac remodeling and progression of heart failure after myocardial infarction are associated with excessive and continuous damage to the extracellular matrix. We hypothesized that injection of in situ-forming alginate hydrogel into recent and old infarcts would provide a temporary scaffold and attenuate adverse cardiac remodeling and dysfunction.
   Methods and Results-We developed a novel absorbable biomaterial composed of calcium-crosslinked alginate solution, which displays low viscosity and, after injection into the infarct, undergoes phase transition into hydrogel. To determine the outcome of the biomaterial after injection, calcium-crosslinked biotin-labeled alginate was injected into the infarct 7 days after anterior myocardial infarction in rat. Serial histology studies showed in situ formation of alginate hydrogel implant, which occupied up to 50% of the scar area. The biomaterial was replaced by connective tissue within 6 weeks. Serial echocardiography studies before and 60 days after injection showed that injection of alginate biomaterial into recent (7 days) infarct increased scar thickness and attenuated left ventricular systolic and diastolic dilatation and dysfunction. These beneficial effects were comparable and sometimes superior to those achieved by neonatal cardiomyocyte transplantation. Moreover, injection of alginate biomaterial into old myocardial infarction (60 days) increased scar thickness and improved systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
   Conclusions-We show for the first time that injection of in situ-forming, bioabsorbable alginate hydrogel is an effective acellular strategy that prevents adverse cardiac remodeling and dysfunction in recent and old myocardial infarctions in rat.

TI Polyelectrolyte complex membranes for specific cell adhesion
SO LANGMUIR
AB The presentation of bioactive ligands on biomaterial surfaces is often confounded by the adsorption of proteins present in the biological milieu, rendering any type of cellular response nonspecific. We have engineered a polyelectrolyte complex membrane that demonstrates specific adhesion of various cell types for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems. Specific cell adhesion is achieved by a three-tiered structure: a silica cross-linked polycation as the bottom (first) tier, a nonfouling polyanion-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) conjugate as the intermediate (second) tier, and the cell-adhesion ligand as the top (third) tier. Each tier of the membrane was characterized in terms of chemical composition and dimensions. Epithelial cells (primary human cortical renal cells and a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line) cultured on the membranes exhibited little cell attachment on the polyanion - PEG second tier and good cell adhesion on the RGD-modified third tier. Thus, the second tier allowed the effect of cell adhesion due to the ligand (third tier) to be isolated and distinguished from nonspecific cell attachment to the first tier. For the culturing of cells in three dimensions, the three-tiered membrane system was applied using a highly swellable chitosan membrane as the first tier. The resulting cell-membrane construct was uniformly dispersed and centrifuged to form a matrix that interacted intimately with cells in the form of a pellet. Presentation of RGD in the latter format enhanced the viability of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) over controls without RGD.

TI Surface modification and properties of Bombyx mori silk fibroin films by
   antimicrobial peptide
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB The Bombyx mori silk fibroin films (SFFs) were modified by a Cecropin B (CB) antimicrobial peptide, (NH2)-NGIVKAGPAIAVLGEAAL-CONH2, using the carbodiimide chemistry method. In order to avoid the dissolution of films during the modification procedure, the SFFs were first treated with 60% (v/v) ethanol aqueous solution, resulting a structural transition from unstable silk I to silk II. The investigation of modification conditions showed that the surface-modified SFFs had the satisfied antimicrobial activity and durability when they were activated by EDC center dot HCl/NHS solution followed by a treatment in CB peptide/PBS buffer (pH 6.5 or 8) solution at ambient temperature for 2 h. Moreover, the surface-modified SFFs showed the smaller contact angle due to the hydrophilic antimicrobial peptides coupled on the film surface, which is essential for the cell adhesion and proliferation. AFM results indicated that the surface roughness of SFFs was considerably increased after the modification by the peptides. The elemental composition analysis results also suggested that the peptides were tightly coupled to the surface of SFFs. This approach may provide a new option to engineer the surface-modified implanted materials preventing the biomaterial-centered infection (BCI). (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Nanostructured poly(vinyl alcohol)/bioactive glass and poly (vinyl

   applications
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Bone tissue engineering is the field of intense research for developing new 3D scaffolds with hierarchical and highly interconnected porous structure. which should match the properties of the tissue that is to be replaced. These materials need to be biocompatible, ideally osteoinductive, osteoconductive and mechanically well-matched. In the present study, we report the development and characterization of novel hybrid macroporous scaffolds of poly(vinyl) alcohol (PVA)/bioactive glass (BaG) through the sol-gel route. The organic-inorganic hybrids with three concentrations of PVA (80, 70 and 60 wt%) and bioactive glass (58SiO(2)-33CaO-9P(2)O(5)) were synthesized by foaming a mixture of polymer solution and bioactive glass via sol-gel precursor solution. PVA with two degree of hydrolysis, 98.5% (high degree) and 80% (low degree) was also investigated, in order to evaluate the influence of residual acetate group present in polymer chain on the final structure and properties of 3D porous nanocomposites produced (PVA/BaG). Bioartificial polymeric hybrids were also investigated in this work by blending PVA with chitosan (chi) and then reacting with bioactive glass reagents using sol-gel processing route (PVA/Chi/BaG). The microstructure, morphology and crystallinity of the hybrid porous scaffolds were characterized through synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. In addition, mechanical properties of hybrids were evaluated by uni-axial compression tests. Biocompatibility, cytotoxicity and cell viability assays were also performed by the MTT method with VERO cell culture. The results have given strong evidence that both hybrid systems of PVA/bioactive glass and PVA/chitosan/bioactive glass were successfully produced and extensively characterized with hierarchical macroporous 3D structure. FTIR spectroscopy associated with XRD and SAXS has proven to be important technique for investigating the formation of PVA/BaG and PVA/Chi/BaG hybrids as organic-inorganic network at micro-nanostructure order. Finally, the developed hybrids have presented suitable mechanical, morphological and cell viability properties for potential biological applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Porous three-dimensional scaffolds made of mineralised collagen:
   Preparation and properties of a biomimetic nanocomposite material for
   tissue engineering of bone
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB For healing of bone defects and as matrix for tissues engineering, porous scaffolds are required that can be easily pre-seeded with cells in the lab and invaded by tissue after implantation. We have developed porous 3D scaffolds consisting of mineralised collagen type I-a nanocomposite, which mimics the composition of extracellular matrix of healthy bone tissue. The steps of material processing as well as the physico-chemical, structural and mechanical properties of this biomaterial are described in detail. The technology of differential scanning calorimetry, which provides an excellent possibility to investigate collagen-based materials, was used to characterise the final scaffold and all its intermediates in situ. Furthermore, the interconnecting porosity of the scaffolds with pore diameters of about 200 mu m has been shown to be highly suitable for homogenous cell seeding, demonstrated with human marrow stromal cells.

TI Effect of UV irradiation on stabilized collagen: Role of chromium(III)
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES B-BIOINTERFACES
AB Research on the effect of UV radiation on stabilized collagen is an area of potential interest owing to the fact that collagen is an important biomaterial finding immense use in various fields. In this present study, effect of UV irradiation on collagen stabilized using chromium(III) has been studied. The physical and optical properties affected by UV irradiation have been detailed. Viscosity measurements have shown that chromium(III) treated collagen has better stability against UV radiation than native collagen. Circular dichroic studies indicate that increase in concentration of chromium(III) does not affect the conformation of collagen however, the duration of irradiation has profound impact on the conformation of collagen. The fluorescence intensity of native collagen has been found to decrease more than that of chromium(III) treated collagen. The difference absorption spectra also shows that chromium(III) treatment brings about more stability to collagen against UV irradiation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Synthesis and characterization of low surface energy fluoropolymers as
   potential barrier coatings in oral care
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB A series of low surface energy fluorinated homopolymers and copolymers has been synthesized and characterized using thermal, optical, spectroscopic, and chromatographic techniques. Their utility as barrier technologies in oral care has been considered, and aqueous nanosuspensions of the materials have been deposited as films on model dental hard surfaces in the presence and absence of a salivary pellicle. Calcium hydroxyapatite has been used as a model for enamel, as has PMMA due to its widespread use in denture fabrication. Surface energy determinations, combined with XPS studies, have provided insights into the molecular-level organization at the surface of the film structures. Studies of solubility in supercritical carbon dioxide have identified the polymers that are suitable for processing in this medium. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Stabilization of the collagen triple helix by O-methylation of
   hydroxyproline residues
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Collagen is the most abundant protein in animals, including humans. The prevalent (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (Hyp) residues of collagen are known to confer great stability upon its triple-helical conformation. The basis for that stability has been attributed to hydration of the pendant hydroxyl groups. Here, that attribution is shown to be incorrect. Replacement of the natural Hyp residues with synthetic (2S,4R)-4-methoxyproline (Mop) residues is shown by circular dichronism spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry to increase the conformational stability of the collagen triple helix. The thermodynamic parameters indicate that, as expected, O-methylation decreases the hydration of the triple helix. Apparently, hydration of Hyp residues is deleterious, rather than advantageous, to the collagen triple helix. The crystal structure of Ac-Mop-OMe reveals the manifestation of two stereoelectronic effects: a gauche effect and an n -> infinity* interaction, which preorganize the main-chain atoms properly for triple helix formation. Thus, the conformational stability conferred upon the collagen triple helix by O-methylation provides strong evidence that the hydroxyl group of Hyp acts primarily through stereoelectronic effects and that is hydration provides no benefit. This information could have practical utility, as Mop could be prepared in situ by the O-methylation of Hyp residues in natural collagen. Such a semisynthetic collagen could have superior properties as a biomaterial.

TI Interaction of human plasma fibrinogen with commercially pure titanium
   as studied with atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy
SO LANGMUIR
AB The surface of a biomaterial interacts with the body fluid upon implantation in the human body. The biocompatibility of a material is strongly influenced by the adsorption of proteins onto the surface. Titanium is frequently used as a biomaterial for implants in orthopedics and cardiovascular devices. Understanding the biocompatibility is very important to improve implants. The surface chemistry of an implant material and its influence on the interaction with body fluid is crucial in that perspective. The main goal of this study was to investigate the conformation of human plasma fibrinogen (HPF) adsorbed on commercially pure titanium (CP Ti) on a molecular level by means of ex situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). With X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy combined with argon ion beam depth profiling it was shown that the oxide layer present at the surface was mainly composed of TiO(2), with a small percentage of Ti(2)O(3). Ex situ AFM imaging showed the conformation of HPF on CP Ti. Single molecules and aggregates of fibrinogen were observed. The trinodular structure of single HPF molecules (two spherical D domains at the distal ends of the extended molecule and the central spherical E domain) adsorbed onto CP Ti was visualized. Aggregate formation through the connection of the D domains of the HPF molecules was observed on CP Ti. The alpha C domains of HPF were not visible on CP Ti. The ex situ AFM images indicated conformational changes of HPF upon adsorption onto CP Ti. The conformation of the adsorbed HPF molecules was different on mica and titanium. The difference in wettability between both substrates caused a larger spread of the protein on the CP Ti surface and thus resulted in a larger perturbation to the native structure of HPF as compared to mica.

TI Engineering cell de-adhesion dynamics on thermoresponsive
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PIPAAm) has been demonstrated as an effective thermoresponsive polymer for non-invasive cell regeneration/recovery. However, little is known about the intricate relationship between the biophysical response of cells and physiochemical properties of PIPAAm during cell recovery. In this study, the de-adhesion kinetics of smooth muscle cell (SMC) on PIPAAm surfaces is probed with unique biophysical techniques. Water-immersion atomic force microscope (AFM) first showed that the nanotopology of PIPAAm surfaces is dependent on the polymerization time and collagen coating. It is found that the initial rate of cell de-adhesion increases with the increase in polymerization time. Moreover, the degree of cell deformation (a/R) and average adhesion energy are reduced with the increase of grafted PIPAAm density during 40 min of cell de-adhesion. It has been shown that collagen coating regulates cell adhesion on biomaterial surface. Interestingly, lower collagen density on PIPAAm leads to higher adhesion energy per cell during the initial 20 min compared with as-prepared PIPAAm, while the initial rate of cell de-adhesion remains unchanged. In contrast, higher collagen density leads to 50% reduction in the initial rate of cell de-adhesion and higher adhesion energy per cell during the entire 90 min. Furthermore, immunostaining of actin provides supporting evidence that the de-adhesion kinetics is correlated with the cytoskeleton transformation during cell de-adhesion below the lower solution critical temperature (LCST).

TI Enhanced antibactericidal function of W4+-doped titania-coated nickel
   ferrite composite nanoparticles: A biomaterial system
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB The study demonstrates a distinct enhancement of antimicrobial activity of W4+-doped titania that is coated on nickel ferrite nanoparticles in comparison to undoped titania. The composite nanoparticles were synthesized by uniquely combining reverse micelle and chemical hydrolysis synthesis methods [Rana S, Rawat J, Misra RDK, Acta Biomater 2005;1:691]. The superior antimicrobial activity of W4+-doped titania is related to the inhibition of electron-hole recombination and decrease in the band gap energy of titania. The function of the ferrite is to facilitate the removal of nanoparticles from the sprayed surface using a small magnetic field. The coating of ferrite nanoparticles with titania retains superparamagnetic character and magnetic strength of composite nanoparticles signifying non-deterioration of magnetic properties and promoting their use as removable antimicrobial photocatalyst nanoparticles.

TI Bone ingrowth in macroporous Bonelike (R) for orthopaedic applications
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the biological behaviour of porous scaffold structures of Bonelike(R) which is suitable for either direct clinical use or tissue engineering applications. Porous cylindrical specimens 8 x 10 mm were implanted in the lateral aspect of the tibia of 13 patients (mean age 54 years), during osteotomy surgery for the treatment of medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee. Implanted cylinders were retrieved at the same time as the removal of the blade plates at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Scanning electron microscopy and histological evaluations were performed to observe the biological responses of human bone tissue to porous Bonelike(R). The penetration depth was determined for all implantation periods, and after 6 months it was already possible to see new bone in the centre of the implanted cylinders, which gives 100% of penetration depth for all implantations periods except for 3 months when bone could only be seen in the peripherical region. Regarding the percentage of the area covered by new bone calculated from two-dimensional histological sections, values of 53 +/- 15, 76 +/- 12 and 88 +/- 9% were achieved for 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively. Due to its structural features porous Bonelikee permitted effective vascularization and bone ingrowth, and therefore was fully osteointegrated as shown in the histological surveys. A slow biomaterial degradation with implantation time is envisaged since the material has displayed surface degradation. Bonelike(R) scaffolds show potential for complete ingrowth of osseous tissue and restoration of vascularization throughout the defected site.

AB Objectives: We determined cytokine profiles for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta after injection of a synthetic extracellular matrix into the vocal fold lamina propria.
   Methods: Transcript expression of inflammatory cytokines was measured with real-time polymerase chain reaction on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, 10, and 21 in 25 rabbits that underwent bilateral vocal fold biopsy with Extracel-LG (Carbylan-GSX 5%) immediately injected into the wound in the left vocal fold and saline solution injected into the wound in the right vocal fold. Two unwounded normal rabbit larynges were also harvested for controls.
   Results: Significantly elevated levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 were measured on day 3 in a comparison between Extracel-LG-injected vocal folds and saline solution-injected control vocal folds and between Extracel-LG-injected vocal folds and normal vocal folds. All cytokine levels returned to baseline by day 21.
   Conclusions: A mild short-term inflammatory response was measured early after injection of a synthetic extracellular matrix into the vocal fold lamina propria.

   poly(epsilon-caprolactone)/eggshell-protein scaffold
SO BIOINSPIRATION & BIOMIMETICS
AB Eggshell membrane (ESM) has potential as a natural scaffold because of its highly porous structure and good biocompatibility. To mimic its structure and surface properties, soluble eggshell membrane protein (SEP) was extracted from ESM and electrospun with a biodegradable polymer, poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL). SEP/PCL micro/nanofibers were fabricated using a coaxial electrospinning process with a dual nozzle and an auxiliary cylindrical electrode. The fiber web was characterized using the water contact angle, pore-size distribution, mechanical properties and cellular behavior. The SEP/PCL web, which demonstrated the feasibility of producing a scaffold with adequate hydrophilicity, suitable pore size and good mechanical properties compared to a pure PCL micro/nanofiber web, exhibits the ability to mimic a natural biomaterial.

TI Measurement of interaction forces between fibrinogen coated probes and
   mica surface with the atomic force microscope: The pH and ionic strength
   effect
SO BIOINTERPHASES
AB The study of protein-surface interactions is of great significance in the design of biomaterials and the evaluation of molecular processes in tissue engineering. The authors have used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to directly measure the force of attraction/adhesion of fibrinogen coated tips to mica surfaces and reveal the effect of the surrounding solution pH and ionic strength on this interaction. Silica colloid spheres were attached to the AFM cantilevers and, after plasma deposition of poly (acrylic acid), fibrinogen molecules were covalently bound on them with the help of the cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) in the presence of N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (sulfo-NHS). The measurements suggest that fibrinogen adsorption is controlled by the screening of electrostatic repulsion as the salt concentration increases from 15 to 150 mM, whereas at higher ionic strength (500 mM) the hydration forces and the compact molecular conformation become crucial, restricting adsorption. The protein attraction to the surface increases at the isoelectric point of fibrinogen (pH 5.8), compared with the physiological pH. At pH 3.5, apart from fibrinogen attraction to the surface, evidence of fibrinogen conformational changes is observed, as the pH and the ionic strength are set back and forth, and these changes may account for fibrinogen aggregation in the protein solution at this pH.

TI Simultaneous processing of fibril formation and cross-linking improves
   mechanical properties of collagen
SO BIOMACROMOLECULES
AB In vitro "simultaneous processing" was investigated in which fibril formation of collagen and cross-linking occur simultaneously in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) as a cross-linking reagent. Fibril formation in simultaneous processing was monitored using turbidity. The EDC in simultaneous processing increased T-1/2 (time required for half of the plateau value in turbidity) and decreased the degree of the fibril formation dose dependently. The reduced fibril formation rate (T-1/2 > 60 s) suggests the introduction of intrafibrillar cross-linking during fibril formation. The collagen gels prepared using simultaneous processing had a compressive modulus that was 6-fold higher than that using sequential processing, which is an advantage of simultaneous processing. Atomic force microscopy images acquired under water on the wet gels demonstrated that the simultaneous processing provided a unique double-network structure: intrafibrillarly cross-linked collagen fibrils among which nonfibrous collagens act as interfibrillar cross-linkages.

TI Enhancement of bone-bonding ability of bioactive titanium by
   prostaglandin E2 receptor selective agonist
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Systemic administration of prostaglandin E2 receptor (EP4) selective agonist increases both bone formation and resorption, and consequently leads to an increase in bone mass. Although previous Studies have reported that EP4 agonist enhanced bone remodeling and fracture healing, it was not known if EP4 agonist activates the bone-biomaterial interface. Bioactive titanium prepared by chemical and thermal treatment can bond to living bone and is suitable for use in clinical applications in cementless fixation devices. Therefore, we examined whether the administration of EP4 agonist enhances the bonding strength between bone and bioactive titanium. Bioactive titanium plates were inserted into the tibia bone of rabbits and examined histologically and biomechanically at 4, 8, and 16 weeks. EP4 agonist was administrated systernically every 2 weeks after surgery. A non-administrated control group, a low-dose group (10 mu g/kg body weight (BW)), and a high-dose group (100 mu g/kg BW) were compared. The bonding strength of bioactive titanium in the EP4 agonist groups was significantly higher than that in the control group at both 4 and 8 weeks, and enhanced bone remodeling and direct bonding around the bioactive titanium plates was observed only in the EP4 agonist groups at 4 weeks. EP4 agonist enhanced bone formation around the bioactive titanium plate, and achieved early direct bone bonding. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Controlled release from multilayer silk biomaterial coatings to modulate
   vascular cell responses
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB A multilayered silk fibroin protein coating system was employed as a drug carrier and delivery system to evaluate vascular cell responses to heparin, paclitaxel, and clopidogrel. The results demonstrated that the silk coating system was an effective system for drug-eluting coatings. such as for stent applications, based on its useful micromechanical properties and biological outcomes. Cell attachment and viability studies with human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs) on the drug-incorporated silk coatings demonstrated that paclitaxel and clopidogrel inhibited smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and retarded endothelial cell proliferation. Heparin-loaded silk multilayers promoted HAEC proliferation while inhibiting HCASMC proliferation, desired outcomes for the prevention of restenosis. The preservation of the phenotype of endothelial cells on silk and heparin-loaded silk coatings was confirmed with the presence of endothelial markers CD-31, CD-146, vWF and VE-Cadherin using immunocytochemistry assays. A preliminary in-vivo study in a porcine aorta showed integrity of the silk coatings after implantation and the reduction of platelet adhesion on the heparin-loaded silk coatings.

TI Peptide- and collagen-based hydrogel substrates for in vitro culture of
   chick cochleae
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The overall goal of this work is to improve the culture of the auditory organ of birds for the dual use of developing a hair cell regeneration model and charting a pathway to the eventual replacement of the hearing organ. In doing so, we develop a protocol for removing the auditory organ from its basement membrane in the inner ear, attach the organ to a series of artificial basement membranes, and conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis of how cell morphology, viability and function change with time. Native matrix cultures, where the epithelium was floating in media with the basement membrane and accessory structures attached, were used as a basis of comparison. PuraMatrix (TM), collagen I, collagen I/chondroitin-sulfate and Matrigel (TM) were chosen to encompass a diverse range of mechanical properties and macromolecule moieties. Surprisingly, we find that PuraMatrix (TM) outperformed the other matrices as a scaffold for sensory organ culture. PuraMatrix (TM), a self-assembled peptide hydrogel, is a biochemically specific culture substrate that contains none of the extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules and growth factors contained in the inner ear's basement membrane. Rheological measurements reveal that PuraMatrix (TM) may be a closer approximation to the stiffness of the soft tissue supporting the auditory organ. Cell density on the PuraMatrix (TM) substrate is comparable to that of the native matrix cultures, despite the absence of the basement membrane and accessory structures. Further studies show that PuraMatrix (TM) supports the culture of functional hair cells over a 72 h period, with a significant increase in the number of functional hair cells in comparison to the organ cultured without a matrix. This is the first example of adhesion of the adult auditory epithelium to a biomaterial for an extended period of time. With further optimization, this system will enable the performance of many novel biophysical and pharmacological studies involving hair cells and supporting cells. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI The effect of electronegativity and angiotensin-converting enzyme
   inhibition on the kinin-forming capacity of polyacrylonitrile dialysis
   membranes
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The combination of negatively-charged membranes and angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) evokes hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) during hemodialysis and bradykinin (BK)-related peptides have been hypothesized as being responsible for these complications. In this study, we tested the effects of neutralizing the membrane electronegativity (zeta potential) of polyacrylonitrile AN69 membranes by coating a polyethyleneimine layer (AN69-ST membranes) over the generation of kinins induced by blood contact with synthetic membranes. We used minidialyzers with AN69 or AN69-ST membranes in an ex vivo model of plasma and we showed that plasma dialysis with AN69 membranes led to significant BK and des-Arg(9)-BK release, which was potentiated by ACEi. This kinin formation was dramatically decreased by AN69-ST membranes, even in the presence of an ACEi, and kinin recovery in the dialysates was also significantly lower with these membranes. High molecular weight kininogen and factor XII detection by immunoblotting of the protein layer coating both membranes corroborated the results: binding of these proteins and contact system activation on AN69-ST membranes were reduced. This ex vivo experimental model applied to the plasma, dialysate and dialysis membrane could be used for the characterization of the kinin-forming capacity of any biomaterial potentially used in vivo in combination with drugs which modulate the pharmacological activity of kinins.

TI The incorporation of poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticles into
   porcine small intestinal submucosa biomaterials
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) derived from porcine small intestine has been intensively studied for its capacity in repairing and regenerating wounded and dysfunctional tissues. However, SIS suffers from a large spectrum of heterogeneity in microarchitecture leading to inconsistent results. In this study, we introduced nanoparticles (NPs) to SIS with an intention of decreasing the heterogeneity and improving the consistency of this biomaterial. As determined by scanning electron microscopy and urea permeability, the optimum NP size was estimated to be between 200 nm and 500 nm using commercial monodisperse latex spheres. The concentration of NPs that is required to alter pore sizes of SIS as determined by urea permeability was estimated to be 1 mg/ml 260 nm poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) NPs. The I mg/ml PLGA NPs loaded in the SIS did not change the tensile properties of the unmodified SIS or even alter pH values in a cell culture environment. More importantly, PLGA NP modified SIS did not affect human mammary endothelial cells (HMEC-1) morphology or adhesion, but actually enhanced HEMC-1 cell growth. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Biocompatibility studies of endothelial cells on a novel calcium
   phosphate/SiO(2)-xerogel composite for bone tissue engineering
SO BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS
AB The bone biomaterial BONITmatrix (R), a nanoporous, granular scaffold composed of hydroxylapatite, calcium phosphate and SiO(2), linked by a dense collagen mesh, was tested for its biocompatibility using endothelial cells (EC) in the form of macrovascular HUVEC, microvascular HDMEC and the endothelial cell line ISOHAS-1. Cells were examined for their adherence and growth on the biomaterial and this was followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy after vital staining or immunocytochemical reactions, as well as by scanning electron microscopy. Macro- and microvascular ECs predominantly spread on BONITmatrixR (R)-collagen mesh-covered surfaces and fibres and maintained their typical morphology. As ECs in vivo must build up a functional vasculature, the seeded cells were further tested for proinflammatory expression markers and cytokine expression after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Protein-coating studies revealed that BONITmatrixR (R)-collagen scaffolds needed human blood serum coating to successfully support the growth of ECs. All cells expressed endothelium-specific surface marker proteins such as PECAM-1, VE-cadherin and vWF. The in vitro data support recent in vivo studies and indicate that this calcium phosphate/SiO(2)-xerogel composite could be a useful scaffold material for tissue engineering.

TI Advanced kinetic model of the Cr(VI) removal by biomaterials at various
   pHs and temperatures
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Recently, a new and simple kinetic model was derived from a basic concept of the redox reaction between Cr(VI) and biomaterials, and successfully described the removal behavior of Cr(VI) under various Cr(VI) and biomaterial concentrations. However, this model did not consider the effects of pH and temperature on the Cr(VI) removal by biomaterials. In this study, a new efficient biomaterial, pine needle, capable of removing Cr(VI) was used as a model one to study the Cr(VI) removal by biomaterials. Analysis of chromium species in aqueous and solid phases revealed that the removal mechanism of Cr(VI) by pine needle was its reduction into Cr(III). The removal rate of Cr(VI) increased with a decrease in pH or with an increase of temperature. Finally, an advanced kinetic model in the form of -d[Cr(VI)]/dt = Ae(Ea/RT) [H+](n)[Cr(VI)][OCs] was derived, and successfully predicted the time-dependent Cr(VI) concentration at various pHs (2-4) and temperatures (10-55 degrees C).

TI Pilot study of two new injectable bulking agents for the treatment of
   faecal incontinence
SO COLORECTAL DISEASE
AB Objective The use of injectable bulking agents for passive faecal incontinence appears to provide reasonable short-term results. However experience with different agents is limited. We report on the outcome of injections with new bulking agents.
   Method Each patient received injections of either Bulkamid(TM) (hydrogel cross-linked with polyacrylamide) or Permacol(TM) (porcine dermal collagen). Assessment included clinical evaluation, anorectal physiological testing, endoanal ultrasonography and questionnaires including the St Mark's Incontinence Score, one week bowel diary card, the Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life Scale and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey. Follow up was at 6 weeks and 6 months, with a further telephone review at a median of 19 months (range 14-22).
   Results Ten patients (nine female), median age 68 years (range 45-79), were enrolled. St Mark's incontinence score (0 = best, 24 = worst) was 15 (range 11-24) at baseline, 12.5 (range 3-18) at 6 weeks and 14 (range 6-22) at 6 months. A 1-week bowel diary and SF-36 forms also showed temporary improvement but this was not sustained beyond 6 weeks.
   Conclusion Bulkamid((TM)) and Permacol((TM)) injections did not have a major effect on faecal incontinence.

TI Surface chemistry influences implant biocompatibility
SO CURRENT TOPICS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Implantable medical devices are increasingly important in the practice of modern medicine. Unfortunately, almost all medical devices suffer to a different extent from adverse reactions, including inflammation, fibrosis, thrombosis and infection. To improve the safety and function of many types of medical implants, a major need exists for development of materials that evoked desired tissue responses. Because implant-associated protein adsorption and conformational changes thereafter have been shown to promote immune reactions, rigorous research efforts have been emphasized on the engineering of surface property (physical and chemical characteristics) to reduce protein adsorption and cell interactions and subsequently improve implant biocompatibility. This brief review is aimed to summarize the past efforts and our recent knowledge about the influence of surface functionality on protein: cell: biomaterial interactions. It is our belief that detailed understandings of bioactivity of surface functionality provide an easy, economic, and specific approach for the future rational design of implantable medical devices with desired tissue reactivity and, hopefully, wound healing capability.

TI Improved biomaterials for tissue engineering applications: Surface
   modification of polymers
SO CURRENT TOPICS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Tissue engineering approaches that combine biomaterial-based scaffolds with protein delivery systems have provided a potential strategy for improved regeneration of damaged tissue. The success of polymeric scaffolds is determined by the response it elicits from the surrounding biological environment. This response is governed, to a large extent, by the surface properties of the scaffold. Surfaces of polymeric scaffolds have a significant effect on protein and cell attachment. Multiple approaches have been developed to provide micrometer to nanometer scale alterations in surface architecture of scaffolds to enable improved protein and cell interactions. Chemical modification of polymeric scaffold surfaces is one of the upcoming approaches that enables enhanced biocompatibility while providing a delivery vehicle for proteins. Similarly, physical adsorption, radiation mediated modifications, grafting, and protein modifications are other methods that have been employed successfully for alterations of surface properties of polymeric scaffolds. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the role of surface properties/chemistry in tissue engineering and briefly discuss some of the methods of surface modification that can provide improved cell and protein interactions. It is hoped that these improved polymeric scaffolds will lead to accelerated and functional tissue regeneration.

TI Characteristic of silver doped DLC films on surface properties and
   protein adsorption
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB Ag-incorporated diamond-like carbon (DLC) films were prepared on Si substrate using a hybrid deposition system composed of an end-Hall-type hydrocarbon ion gun and a silver DC magnetron sputter source. Ag was selected due to their potential values of biomaterial. The concentration of Ag in the films was varied from 0.1 to 9.7 at.% by controlling the fraction of Ar in the reaction gas mixture with benzene. In order to understand the influence of incorporated Ag on wettability, the surface energy and the protein adsorption as an indirect haemo-compatibility were measured. The surface energy of the Ag-incorporated DLC film decreased gradually with the increase of the Ag concentration. The haemo-compatibility was examined by the adsorption ratio of albumin/fibrinogen as an indirect method and improved with the increase of Ag concentration. The surface and biological behaviors of the films will be discussed in terms of the atomic bond characteristic and microstructure induced by Ag incorporation. Our results demonstrate that the Ag-incorporated DLC films are potentially useful as biomedical devices having good haemo-compatibility and hydrophobic characteristics. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

TI Influence of biodegradable and non-biodegradable material surfaces on
   the differentiation of human monocyte-derived macrophages
SO DIFFERENTIATION
AB Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and multinucleated foreign body giant cells (FBGC) are the primary cell types that remain at the cell-material interface of polyurethane (PU)-based medical devices as a result of chronic inflammatory responses. In vitro studies have demonstrated that MDM possess degradative potential toward PU, which can result in device failure. Because most studies have followed the degradation potential, morphology, and function of these cells only once fully differentiated, the current study investigated the influence of a non-degradable control tissue culture-grade polystyrene (TCPS) surface relative to two degradable model polycarbonate-urethanes (PCNU), of different chemistry, on various parameters of MDM morphology and function during a 14-day differentiation time course. The differentiation of human monocytes isolated from whole blood on PCNU materials resulted in increased cell attachment, decreased multinucleation, and significant decreases in cell spreading when compared with cells differentiated on TCPS. Actin-stained podosome-like cell adhesion structures were increased in PCNU-adherent cells, accompanied by an alteration in beta-actin and vinculin protein expression. The expression of the CD68 macrophage marker was reduced when cells were adherent to the PCNU materials and compared with TCPS, suggesting altered cell activation by the degradable relative to non-degradable materials. The degradative potential of these cells was altered by the material surface they were exposed to as measured by esterase activity and protein expression of monocyte-specific esterase. This was also supported by physical material breakdown evident in scanning electron microscopy images that illustrated holes in the PCNU films generated by the presence of differentiating MDM. It was concluded from these studies that PCNU materials significantly alter the function and morphology of differentiating MDM. This must be taken into consideration when studying cell-material interactions because these cells will receive cues from their immediate environment (including the biomaterial) upon differentiation, thereby affecting their resulting phenotype.

TI Preparation of poly 2-hydroxyethyl methaerylate functionalized carbon
   nanotubes as novel biomaterial nanocomposites
SO EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL
AB We report a simple method for the functionalization of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) with a biomedically important polymer, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly(HEMA)), by chemical grafting of HEMA monomer followed by free radical polymerization. The nanotubes were first oxidized with a mixture of cone. nitric acid and Sulfuric acid (1:3), in order to obtain carboxylic acid functionalized MWNTs. Then the grafting of HEMA oil to the surface of MWNTs was carried by chemical functionalization of HEMA with acid chloride-bound nanotubes by esterification reaction. FT-IR was used to identify functionalization of -COOH and HEMA groups attached to the surface of the nanotubes. The presence of poly(HEMA) oil the nanotubes were confirmed by FESEM, TEM, and TGA analyses. Additionally, the dispersibility of the polymer functionalized nanotubes in methanol was also demonstrated. Considering the biomedical importance of poly(HEMA) and the recent successful in vivo studies oil CNTs, in future, these materials are expected to be useful in the pharmaceutical industry as novel biomaterials composites with potential applications in drug delivery.

TI Development of foreign body giant cells in response to implantation of
   Spongostan (R) as a scaffold for cartilage tissue engineering
SO IN VIVO
AB Spongostan (R) a gelatinous haemostatic sponge, is used in surgety. Moreover, Spongostano (R) may serve as a scaffold for proteins or cells implanted into defects. At the site of biomaterial implantation, foreign body giant cells (FBGCs) may develop which are responsible for Spongostano degradation. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether Spongostano may serve as a scaffold in allogenic grafting of chondrocytes developed from rabbit auricular cartilage. The obtained results indicate that Spongostano fulfils its,function as a cell scaffold, induces no inflammatory reaction and involves development of foreign body giant cells which participate in the process of its degradation. Microscopic observation showed that FBGCs manifest presence of cytoplasmic projections and lysosomes, which participate in phagocytosis of the applied scaffold.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB In the present study, an indigenous medicinal plant, Tridax procumbens (Asteraceae) was used as bioadsorbent for the removal of Cr (III) ions from synthetic wastewater and the method was also applied for real sample analysis. The biosorption of Cr (III) was a two-stage batch reactor process. In the first stage, raw biomaterial was used to the conversion of Cr (VI) into Cr (III). The amount of the biomaterial was 2.5g. The percent conversion was 100. The second stage involved the biosorption of Cr (III) onto the activated carbon of the biomaterial. The result indicated that, the biosorption of Cr (III) was 98.5 % at the optimum pH of 3.2. The experiments were carried out at the temperature of 25 +/- 2 degrees C. The optimum contact time was 150 min and the adsorbent dose was 2.5g of activated carbon. The effect of concentration was also studied for the design of the treatment systems and this methodology is highly suitable for the treatment of chromium containing wastewater.

TI Wavelength dependence of matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization
   using a tunable mid-infrared laser
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY
AB Matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization by infrared laser (IR-MALDI) is expected to be an effective methods for soft-ionization of high-molecular weight proteins and intracellular proteins. IR-MALDI is not widely used because its low sensitivity, complexity, high cost, and as it does not work well on commercial MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometers (TOFMSs). We employed a tunable mid-infrared (MIR) laser as a light source for MALDI to investigate the IR-MALDI. The laser wavelength can be tuned within a range from 5.5 to 10.0 mu m, and included several biomaterial group vibration modes. We evaluated the wavelength dependence of ionization in IR-MALDI for four matrices: succinic acid, urea, 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapic acid) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB). These matrices contained various groups of vibration modes, and absorbed an infrared (IR) energy at a specific wavelength. The mass spectra of angiotensin 11 was obtained at a specific wavelength corresponding to the C=O stretching and benzene ring vibration mode. In IR-MALDI, we considered the strong molecular bond attracting an electron from a neighboring hydrogen atom, possibly protonating the hydrogen atom. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Bone regeneration after demineralized bone matrix and castor oil
   (Ricinus communis) polyurethane implantation
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ORAL SCIENCE
AB Innocuous biocompatible materials have been searched to repair or reconstruct bone defects. Their goal is to restore the function of live or dead tissues. This study compared connective tissue and bone reaction when exposed to demineralized bovine bone matrix and a polyurethane resin derived from castor bean (Ricinus communis). Forty-five rats were assigned to 3 groups of 15 animals (control, bovine bone and polyurethane). A cylindrical defect was created on mandible base and filled with bovine bone matrix and the polyurethane. Control group received no treatment. Analyses were performed after 15, 45 and 60 days (5 animals each). Histological analysis revealed connective tissue tolerance to bovine bone with local inflammatory response similar to that of the control group. After 15 days, all groups demonstrated similar outcomes, with mild inflammatory reaction, probably due to the surgical procedure rather than to the material. In the polymer group, after 60 days, scarce multinucleated cells could still be observed. In general, all groups showed good stability and osteogenic connective tissue with blood vessels into the surgical area. The results suggest biocompatibility of both materials, seen by their integration into rat mandible. Moreover, the polyurethane seems to be an alternative in bone reconstruction and it is an inexhaustible source of biomaterial.

SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Model in vitro culturing systems were developed to analyze roles of biomaterial-induced leukocyte activation on endothelial cell (EC) and smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype, and their crosstalk. Isolated monocytes or neutrophils were pretreated with model biomaterial beads and applied directly to "more secretory" (cultured in media containing 5% fetal bovine serum) or forced contractile (serum and growth factor starved) human aortic SMCs (HASMCs), or to the human aortic EC (HAEC) surface of HAEC/HASMC cocultures (HASMC phenotype varied to be "more or less secretory") for 5 or 24 h of static culture. Surface expression of proinflammatory [ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin], procoagulant (tissue factor), and anticoagulant (thrombomodulin) markers, as well as HAEC proliferation, were assessed by flow cytometry. Incubation of HAEC with biomaterial-pretreated monocytes (and neutrophils to lesser degree) suppressed HAEC proliferation and induced a proinflammatory/procoagulant HAEC phenotype. This HAEC phenotype was amplified in coculture with "more secretory" HASMCs and subdued in coculture with "less secretory" HASMCs. Direct incubation of biomaterial-pretreated monocytes or neutrophils with "more secretory" HASMCs further increased HASMC ICAM-1 and tissue factor expression. Direct incubation of biomaterial-pretreated monocytes or neutrophils with forced contractile HASMCs upregulated ICAM-1, VCAM-I, and tissue factor expression above the presence of serum-containing media alone.

TI Use of a low-cost biosorbent to remove pesticides from wastewater
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB A lignocellulosic substrate (LS) obtained from our local agroindustry was used as a low-cost and effective adsorbent for the removal of pesticides from wastewaters. The studied pesticides were terbumeton (N-(1,1-dimethyl)-N'ethyl-6-methoxy-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine), desethyl terbumeton (N-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-methoxy-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine), dimetomorph (4-[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) acryloyl]morpholine), and isoproturon (3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea). Batch and column experiments were conducted as a function of pH and pesticide concentration under laboratory and industrial conditions. The concentration range studied for the pesticides varied from 2 x 10(-7) to 3 x 10(-4) mol L-1. The influence of organic and inorganic pollutants was assessed by studying the retention of pesticide in the presence of copper(II) and a surfactant. These experiments indicated that LS is an efficient adsorbent toward the investigated pesticides and has little influence of the other pollutants. The kinetic adsorptions are fast, and the amounts of adsorbed pesticide varied from 1 to 8 g kg(-1) of LS. These retention capacities show that LS can provide a simple, effective, and cheap method for removing pesticides from contaminated waters. Thus, this biomaterial may be useful for cleaning up polluted waters.

TI Preparation and properties of a novel bone repair composite:
   nano-hydroxyapatite/chitosan/carboxymethyl cellulose
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB Nano-hydroxyapatite/chitosan/carboxymethyl cellulose (n-HA/CS/CMC) composites with weight ratios of 70/10/20, 70/15/15 and 70/20/10 were prepared through a co-solution method. The properties of the composites were characterized by means of burn-out test, IR, XRD, TEM and universal material testing machine. The degradation and bioactivity were also investigated by in vitro test in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for 8 weeks. The results showed that n-HA particles were dispersed uniformly in organic phase, and strong chemical interactions formed among the three phases. Moreover, the composites were similar to natural bone in morphology and size. In addition, the compressive strength was improved compared with n-HA/CS composite. The biodegradation rate was controllable by altering weight ratio of the CS/CMC. Meanwhile, the composites could induce apatite particles to deposit in SBF. All the above results indicate that the novel composites of n-HA/CS/CMC have a promising prospect used for bone repair materials in view of the good mechanical property, adjustable biodegradation rate and bioactivity in SBF. Additionally, the study would provide a good guide to exploit clinical application of natural cellulose.

TI Preparation and property of a novel bone graft composite consisting of
   rhBMP-2 loaded PLGA microspheres and calcium phosphate cement
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB Calcium phosphate cement (CPC) is a highly promising bone substitute and an excellent carrier for delivering growth factors. Yet, the lack of macro-porosity and osteoinductive ability, limit its use. This study is aimed at developing a novel biodegradable biomaterial for bone repair with both highly osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties. RhBMP-2 loaded PLGA microspheres were incorporated into rhBMP-2/CPC for macropores for bone ingrowth. The compressive strength, crystallinity, microscopic structure, and bioactivity of the composites were investigated. The results showed that with the incorporation of rhBMP-2 loaded PLGA microspheres, the compressive strength was decreased from (29.48 +/- 6.42) MPa to (8.26 +/- 3.58) MPa. X-ray diffraction revealed that the crystallinity pattern of HA formed by CPC had no significant change. Inside the composite, the microspheres distributed homogeneously and contacted intimately with the HA matrix, as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). When the PLGA microspheres dissolved after having been emerged in PBS for 56 days, macropores were created within the CPC. The rhBMP-2/PLGA/CPC composite, showing a 4.9% initial release of rhBMP-2 in 24 h, followed by a prolonged release for 28 days, should have a greater amount of rhBMP-2 released compared to the CPC delivery system. When rabbit marrow stromal cells were cocultured with the composite, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OC) showed a dose response to the rhBMP-2 released from the composite, indicating that the activity of rhBMP-2 was retained. This study shows that the new composite reveals more rhBMP-2 release and osteogenic activity. This novel BMP/PLGA/CPC composite could be a promising synthetic bone graft in craniofacial and orthopedic repairs.

TI Creatinine biomaterial thin films grown by laser techniques
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB Creatinine thin films were synthesised by matrix assisted pulsed laser deposition (PLD) techniques for enzyme-based biosensor applications. An UV KrF* (lambda = 248 nm, tau similar to 10 ns) excimer laser source was used for the irradiation of the targets at incident fluence values in the 0.3-0.5 J/cm(2) range. For the matrix assisted PLD the targets consisted on a frozen composite obtained by dissolving the biomaterials in distilled water. The surface morphology, chemical composition and structure of the obtained biomaterial thin films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy as a function of the target preparation procedure and incident laser fluence.

TI Comparative in vitro study of the proliferation and growth of ovine
   osteoblast-like cells on various alloplastic biomaterials manufactured
   for augmentation and reconstruction of tissue or bone defects
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB In this in vitro study ovine osteoblast-like cells were cultured on seven different alloplastic biomaterials used for augmentation and for reconstruction of bone defects in dental and craniomaxillofacial surgery. The aim of this study was to examine the growth behaviour (viability, cell density and morphology) of ovine osteoblast-like cells on the investigated biomaterials to get knowledge which biomaterial is qualified to act as a cell carrier system in further in vivo experiments. The biomaterials were either synthetically manufactured or of natural origin. As synthetically manufactured biomaterials Ethisorb(R), MakroSorb(R), Palacos(R)R, and PDS(R) film were used. As biomaterials of natural origin Beriplast(R)P, Bio-Oss(R) and Titanmesh were investigated. The cell proliferation and cell colonization were analyzed by a proliferation assay and scanning electron microscopy. Osteoblast-like cells proliferated and attached on all biomaterials, except on Beriplast(R). On Ethisorb(R) the highest cell proliferation rate was measured followed by Palacos(R)R. Both biomaterials offer suitable growth and proliferation conditions for ovine osteoblast-like cells. The proliferation rates of Bio-Oss(R), MakroSorb(R), PDS(R)-film and Titanmesh were low and SEM examinations of these materials showed less spread osteoblast-like cells. The results showed that ovine osteoblast-like cells appear to be sensitive to substrate composition and topography. This in vitro study provides the basis for further in vivo studies using the sheep model to examine the biocompatibility and the long-term interaction between the test material and tissue (bone regeneration).

TI Fabrication of porous substrates: A review of processes using pore
   forming agents in the biomaterial field
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
AB This paper is a review of solid and casting manufacturing processes able to create porous materials, mainly in the biomaterial field. The considered methods are based on pore forming agents that are removed either by heating or by dissolution. All techniques lead to products presenting pores with amount, size, and shape are close to those of the initial pore formers. Porosities up to 90% with pores ranging from 1 to 2000 mu m are reported. Major differences concern macrointerconnections that are more frequently obtained using foams, or porogens which undergo a melting stage during firing. Casting methods combined with solid free form fabrication are promising for the design of porous network through the manufacturing of 3D scaffolds corresponding to the desired porosity.

TI Adverse effects associated with the use of porcine cross-linked collagen
   implants in an experimental model of incisional hernia repair
SO JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
AB Background. Porcine cross-linked collagen (PermaCol, PCL; TSL, Aldershot, United Kingdom) has been proposed as permanent biomaterial in incisional. hernia repair. We evaluated the biocompatibility of PCL in an established animal model.
   Material and methods. In 10 Sprague Dawley rats, two hernias per animal were created in the abdominal wall left and right of the linea alba (1.5 cm in diameter), and the peritoneum was spared. The lesions were left untreated for 10 days, until incisional hernias developed. These defects were covered with non-perforated (out-of-the-box, n = 12) or perforated (modified; n = 8) PCL (2 x 2 cm). In a first step, 12 non-perforated implants were tested in a short-term observation period of 17 days. Eight of these non-perforated implants were fibrin sealed (0.3 mL, Tissucol; Baxter, Vienna, Austria), whereas four non-perforated implants were sutured with non-resorbable material. In a second step, perforations were added as modification to PCL to facilitate drainage of fluids, cell ingrowth, and transgression of fibrin sealant. All perforated implants were fibrin sealed and included in a long-term observation period of 3 months. The observation periods allowed the evaluation of the complete degradation of the fibrin sealant fixation after 2 weeks and of the implant integration in a chronic timeframe. Implant sites were analyzed macroscopically and histologically.
   Results. All PCL samples elicited strong local inflammation with signs of foreign body reaction. Integration of perforated PCL appeared limited after 3 months. Three animals had to be euthanized prior to intended time points because of transcutaneous migration of implants.
   Conclusions. In an experimental model of incisional hernia repair, PCL does not integrate well in the abdominal wall and shows poor biocompatibility. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Viscoelastic properties of a biological hydrogel produced from soybean
   oil
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN OIL CHEMISTS SOCIETY
AB Hydrogels formed from biopolymers or natural sources have special advantages because they may have biodegradable and biocompatible properties. The viscoelastic properties of a newly developed biological hydrogel made from epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) were investigated. The material called HPESO is a hydrolytic product of polymerized ESO (PESO). HPESO exhibited viscoelastic solid or gel behavior above 2% (wt. %) concentration at room temperature and viscous liquid behavior at 55 degrees C. The thermal assembly disassembly reassembly function of the HPESO hydrogel was completely reversible. The viscoelastic properties of HPESO were dependent on concentration. Analysis of modulus and concentration dependence and stress relaxation measurement indicated that HPESO was a physical gel where the cross-linkers between the molecules were physical junctions. HPESO hydrogel also exhibited fast initial recovery of its viscoelastic properties after being subjected to mechanical shear disruption. The function and behavior of the HPESO hydrogel suggest that this biomaterial may be suitable for applications in drug delivery and scaffolds of bioengineering and tissue engineering.

SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB Since Ti-based glassy alloys have high strength and high corrosion resistance, it is useful for an application field of substitution material for biomaterials such as living body bone. For the biomaterial use, the glassy alloys are required to substitute the harmful elements for the human body such as Ni. In the present study, we prepared the Ti47.4Cu42Zr5.3TM5.3(TM = Co, Fe) glassy alloy sheets by a twin-roller casting method, and investigated their thermal stability and mechanical properties. The prepared alloy sheets had flat surfaces with highly white luster, and exhibited a distinct glass transition typical to a glassy phase. The super-cooled liquid region Delta Tx defined by the difference between the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the onset temperature for crystallization (Tx) is 50 K for the Ni-containing alloy, 36 K for the Co-containing alloy and 32 K for the Fe-containing alloy. All the alloy sheets exhibit good bending ductility and their Vickers hardness is in the range of 590 to 600.

TI New 3D hyaluronan-based scaffold for in vitro reconstruction of the rat
   sciatic nerve
SO NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH
CT Conference on Long Lasting Denervated Muscle
CY APR, 2007
CL Padua, ITALY
AB Objective: For peripheral nerve regeneration, three-dimensional distribution and growth of cells within the porous scaffold are of clinical significance. The put-pose of this study was to test in vitro a novel hyaluronic acid-based tubular conduit (HYAFF-11 biomaterials: 1 x 10 mm) as a nerve guide.
   Methods: Human fibroblasts, RN22 Schwann cell lines, human, umbilical vein endothelial cells and primary nerve cells, obtained from neonatal rat sciatic nerve, were harvested and seeded on HYAFF-11 devices. Histologic (hematoxylin-eosin), immunohistochemical (antibodies to S100, CD31 and Von Willebrand factor) and PCR analyses were performed after 7 and 14 days from cell seeding onto biomaterials. MTT-based (thiazolyl blue) and DELFIA cell proliferation kit tests were performed to observe the biocompatibility of the cells cultured within the biomaterial devices.
   Results: We concluded that the conduits were not cytotoxic and demonstrated that cultured RN22 Schwann cells and rat Schwann cells grow in vitro on new artificial nerve conduits. We thus inferred that the HYAFF-11 conduit was a suitable biomaterial able to support nerve cell growth in vitro and after 14 days of cultivation, remained circular with a round lumen, maintaining the size and shape of its original architecture. Finally, attachment and proliferation of endothelial cells attested to the feasibility of developing a coculture system to promote in vivo integration of a microvascularized nerve substitute.
   Discussion: HYAFF-11 pre-seeded with Schwann and endothelial cells has the potential to be an alternative to autografting for the repair of long peripheral nerve defects.

TI A novel biomimetic material for engineering postsurgical adhesion using
   the injured digital flexor tendon-synovial complex as an in vivo model
SO PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
AB Background: Many surgical procedures are complicated by adhesions. These restrictive fibrotic bands form between normally separate gliding tissue layers, potentially impairing function. The authors tested the adhesion-modifying effect of a novel fibronectin-derived biomimetic biomaterial in a tendon-synovial complex injury model.
   Methods: The deep flexor tendons of digits 2 and 4 in the right forepaw of 15 New Zealand White rabbits were subjected to 5-mm-long partial tenotomies. Animals were randomized to receive biomaterial tubes enveloping the tendon injuries or left untreated. Digits, amputated at 2 weeks, were randomized to mechanical pullout assessments of adhesion strength or to quantitative histologic cellularity and immunohistochemical proliferation (Ki67) assessments.
   Results: The mean peak pullout force required to break the adhesions was reduced from 7.70 N (n = 6) in untreated digits to 0.31 N (n = 7) in biomaterial-treated digits (p = 0.001). The mean structural stiffness of the adhesions was also significantly reduced (p = 0.001). Histologically, treated and untreated digits demonstrated an equal incidence of adhesions. The treated adhesions were 55 percent less cellular at their surface than the untreated injured controls (p = 0.003). Treated tendons were 8 percent more cellular (with equal numbers of proliferating cells) at their surface and significantly more cellular within their bulk than positive controls (p <= 0.05).
   Conclusion: This study suggests a significant reduction in the restrictive nature of postsurgical adhesions following treatment with the antiadhesive biomaterial without compromising tendon cellularity.

TI Iron-manganese: new class of metallic degradable biomaterials prepared
   by powder metallurgy
SO POWDER METALLURGY
AB An Fe-35 wt-%Mn alloy, aimed to be used as a metallic degradable biomaterial for stent applications, was prepared via a powder metallurgy route. The effects of processing conditions on the microstructure, mechanical properties, magnetic susceptibility and corrosion behaviour were investigated and the results were compared to those of the SS316L alloy, a gold standard for stent applications. The Fe35Mn alloy was found to be essentially austenitic with fine MnO particles aligned along the rolling direction. The alloy is ductile with a strength approaching that of wrought SS316L. It exhibits antiferromagnetic behaviour and its magnetic susceptibility is not altered by plastic deformation, providing an excellent MRI compatibility. Its corrosion rate was evaluated in a modified Hank's solution, and found superior to that of pure iron ( slow in vivo degradation rate). In conclusion, the mechanical, magnetic and corrosion characteristics of the Fe35Mn alloy are considered suitable for further development of a new class of degradable metallic biomaterials.

TI Altered bioreactivity and limited osteoconductivity of calcium
   sulfate-based bone cements in the osteoporotic rat spine
SO SPINE JOURNAL
AB BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Previous studies documenting the osteoconductive nature of calcium sulfate (CaSO4)-based biomaterials have been largely limited to animal models exhibiting nonosteoporotic bone biology. In addition to diminished bone mineral density (BMD) and altered bone microarchitecture, the osteoporosis phenotype is associated with a proinflammatory and proosteolytic state. Thus, osteoporosis may elicit an amplified bioreactivity to common orthopedic biomaterials, potentially limiting their full osteoconductive capabilities in vivo.
   PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that CaSO4-based bone cements exhibit altered bioreactivity and limited osteoconductivity in response to osteoporotic conditions.
   STUDY DESIGN: 1) Microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) radiomorphometry study and 2) histological analysis.
   METHODS: Our laboratory has previously established a preclinical model of osteoporosis using the rodent osteoporotic spine (OS). Caudal vertebral defects were filled with either CaSO4 or CaSO4/CaPO4 (Hybrid) cement for each group (n=4). Over 8 weeks, cement resorption profiles, BMD, average cortical thickness, average trabecular thickness, average trabecular spacing, and diaphyseal bone volume fraction were assessed via micro-CT radiomorphometry. Histological analysis was performed on vertebrae obtained postsurgery and at Week 8.
   RESULTS: Both materials displayed an accelerated cement resorption profile after implantation into the OS vertebrae. Hybrid cement exhibited slower resorption compared with that of CaSO4 under both normal female rats (NL) and OS conditions. The cement-mediated bone augmentation observed in the NL spine was altered under OS conditions.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that cement bioreactivity is heightened and osteoconductivity may be limited in a preclinical model of the OS. The disparity between the two resorption profiles suggests that this accelerated cement resorption is a material-dependent phenomenon. The proinflammatory and pro-osteolytic bone environment associated with the osteoporosis disease state may contribute to the accelerated resorption and altered osteoconductivity exhibited by both materials. Future study of potential biomaterials intended for use within the OS may necessitate further exploration of the relationship between biomaterial performance and osteoporosis bone biology.

TI The interaction of human serum albumin with titanium studied by means of
   atomic force microscopy
SO SURFACE AND INTERFACE ANALYSIS
AB Titanium is frequently used as a biomaterial for implants in orthopaedics and cardiovascular devices. Understanding the biocompatibility, which is strongly influenced by the adsorption of proteins onto the surface, is very important to improve implants. The surface chemistry of an implant material and its influence on the interaction with body fluid is crucial in that perspective. The main goal of this study was to investigate the conformation of human serum albumin (HSA) with commercially pure titanium (CP Ti) on a molecular level. Both ex situ and in situ AFM imaging showed the conformation of HSA on CP Ti and on mica, which was used as a reference material. Single molecules and aggregates of albumin were observed. HSA can be recognised by the globular shape. The conformation of the adsorbed HSA molecules was different on titanium and mica, for both the ex situ and in situ imaging. The difference in wettability between both substrates caused a larger spread of the protein on the CP Ti surface and thus resulted in a larger perturbation of the native structure of HSA as compared to mica.

TI The release behavior of CHX from polymer-coated titanium surfaces
SO SURFACE AND INTERFACE ANALYSIS
AB Titanium has been successfully used in dental implants due to its favorable biological response. However, implant failures caused by infection often occurred with a complex microbial exposure. Chlorhexidine (CHX) is effective against a wide variety of bacteria as well as fungi. The aim of the present study is to investigate the release behavior of CHX from CHX-containing polylactide (PLA)-coated titanium. Commercially, pure titanium was anodized with surfaces exposed to an anodic-forming voltage of 250 V for 3 min. The anodized titanium surfaces were then coated with a PLA/CHX solution. Topographic evaluation was performed using a SEM, and the antibacterial effect was evaluated. The concentrations of CHX were measured using a UV spectrophotometer. In the surface morphology analysis, the uncoated titanium surface showed a porous structure, but the surfaces coated with a polymer displayed nonporous structures and wrinkled surfaces. In addition, there were no differences in the surface roughness between the uncoated and coated surface. On the basis of the comparative analysis of both the UV absorbance of CHX and the surface characteristics, we concluded that the PLA coating can effectively control the release of CHX on anodized titanium surfaces.

TI Preparation of polyethylene oxide/chitosan fiber membranes by
   electrospinning and the evaluation of biocompatibility
SO TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB Chitosan is an excellent material for medical use because it is nontoxic, has good biocompatibility, exhibits antimicrobial activity, supports the healing of wounds, etc. Electrospinning yields nanofibers which have wide applications, such as high-performance filters, biomaterial scaffolds for vascular grafts or wound dressings, etc. In this investigation, electrospinning was performed in an electric field of 0.6 kV/cm with a polyethylene oxide to chitosan ratio of 60:40. The polymer nanofibers had diameters that ranged from a few nanometers to several micrometers (approximately 30 nm).

TI A biomaterial composed of collagen and solubilized elastin enhances
   angiogenesis and elastic fiber formation without calcification
SO TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A
AB Elastin is the prime protein in elastic tissues that contributes to elasticity of, for example, lung, aorta, and skin. Upon injury, elastic fibers are not readily replaced, which hampers tissue regeneration. Incorporation of solubilized elastin (hydrolyzed insoluble elastin fibers or elastin peptides) in biomaterials may improve regeneration, because solubilized elastin is able to promote proliferation as well as elastin synthesis. Porous biomaterials composed of highly purified collagen without and without elastin fibers or solubilized elastin were prepared by freezing and lyophilization. Solubilized elastin formed spherical structures that were incorporated in the collagenous part of the scaffolds and that persisted after chemical crosslinking of the scaffolds. Crosslinked scaffolds were subcutaneously implanted in young Sprague Dawley rats. Collagen-solubilized elastin and collagen scaffolds showed no calcification in this sensitive calcification model, in contrast to scaffolds containing elastin fibers. Collagen-solubilized elastin scaffolds also induced angiogenesis, as revealed by type IV collagen staining, and promoted elastic fiber synthesis, as shown with antibodies against rat elastin and fibrillin-1. It is concluded that scaffolds produced from collagen and solubilized elastin present a non-calcifying biomaterial with a capacity for soft-tissue regeneration, especially in relation to elastic fiber synthesis.

TI Assessment of dermal wound repair after collagen implantation with
   optical coherence tomography
SO TISSUE ENGINEERING PART C-METHODS
AB We present an animal study to examine the utility and potential limitations of optical coherence tomography (OCT) for noninvasive evaluation of biomaterial scaffold-assisted wound healing. The transverse and axial resolutions of the OCT system at the wavelength of 1.3 mu m were 12 and 10 mu m, respectively. A murine full-thickness transcutaneous wound model was employed, in which a phi 10mm full-thickness wound was created on the back of each male Balb/cJ mouse and a porous collagen scaffold was implanted in the wound bed followed by coverage with a Tegaderm (TM) film. Sequential cross-sectional OCT scans were performed at different time points postsurgical intervention to track morphological changes during wound recovery, and the captured OCT images were validated by their corresponding histological specimens. The results indicated that with removal of the high-scattering skin, OCT was capable of imaging to a depth of over 1.5mm into the wound bed and differentiating various features evolved during wound healing at a high resolution approaching histopathology. OCT was able to not only delineate the epidermis and dermis of normal mouse skin, but also differentiate collagen implant from the underlying subcutaneous tissue; besides, it could track the wound size changes in both lateral and vertical directions. More importantly, OCT was able to detect inflammation, early re-epithelialization, and resorption of the collagen scaffold. These findings suggested the potential of OCT for noninvasive and high-resolution monitoring of assisted wound healing in vivo, longitudinally, and instantaneously.

TI Mechanism of ultrahigh, elongation rate of poly(D,L-lactide)-matrix
   composite biomaterial containing nano-apatite fillers
SO MATERIALS LETTERS
AB This study aims to discuss the mechanism of ultrahigh elongation rate of nano-apatite/poly(D,L-lactide) (PDLLA) composite biomaterials prepared by combining traditional solution co-blending and hot pressing techniques. An ultrahigh elongation rate of PDLLA-matrix composite film with nano-apatite fillers was found in our tensile testing experiments. These surprising results could be expressly explained by the structure characteristics of PDLLA-matrix nanocomposites. The linear chains of the PDLLA-matrix materials were cross-linked and fixed by the nano-sized crystallites with high specific surface energy when nano particles were incorporated into PDLLA polymer to form composite. Structure change of the cross-linked PDLLA matrix caused the composite to exhibit high fixation strength between PDLLA molecular chains and nano-apatite particles by a large amount of the cross-link junctions and further brought on larger elastic and plastic deformation than one of pure PDLLA polymer. On the other hand, high nano-apatite contents in composites could lead to the early rupture owing to nano-apatite agglomeration and decrease the elongation rate of the composites.

TI Biomaterials in cardiac tissue engineering: Ten years of research survey
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING R-REPORTS
AB Driven by enormous clinical need, myocardial tissue engineering has become a prime focus of research within the field of tissue engineering. Myocardial tissue engineering combines isolated functional cardiomyocytes and a biodegradable or nondegradable biomaterial to repair diseased heart muscle. The challenges in heart muscle engineering include cell related issues (such as scale up in a short timeframe, efficiency of cell seeding or cell survival rate, and immune rejection), the design and fabrication of myocardial tissue engineering substrates, and the engineering of tissue constructs in vitro and in vivo. Several approaches have been put forward, and a number of models combining various polymeric biomaterials, cell sources and bioreactors have been developed in the last 10 years for myocardial tissue engineering. This review provides a comprehensive update on the biomaterials, as well as cells and biomimetic systems, used in the engineering of the cardiac muscle. The article is organized as follows. A historic perspective of the evolution of cardiac medicine and emergence of cardiac tissue engineering is presented in the first section. Following a review on the cells used in myocardial tissue engineering (second section), the third section presents a review on biomaterials used in myocardial tissue engineering. This section starts with an overview of the development of tissue engineering substrates and goes on to discuss the selection of biomaterials and design of solid and porous substrates. Then the applications of a variety of biomaterials used in different approaches of myocardial tissue engineering are reviewed in great detail, and related issues and topics that remain challenges for the future progress of the field are identified at the end of each subsection. This is followed by a brief review on the development of bioreactors (fourth section), which is an important achievement in the field of myocardial tissue engineering, and which is also related to the biomaterials developed. At the end of this article, the major achievements and remaining challenges are summarized, and the most promising paradigm for the future of heart muscle tissue engineering is proposed (fifth section).

TI Novel silsesquioxane mixture-modified high elongation polyurethane with
   reduced platelet adhesion
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB We have successfully synthesized a kind of novel silsesquioxane mixture that can be used to modify the surface of biomaterial polyurethane (PU) for the purpose of making silsesquioxane/PU as low-price and high-quality biomaterial. HPLC, FTIR and Si-29 NMR are used to characterize as-synthesized silsesquioxane mixture. XPS figure and SEM images show the silsesquioxane particles really self-assemble on the PU surface. Contact angle measurements verify that there is a large hysteresis loop, which relates to low- and high-surface free energy component on the surface. Platelet adsorption at 90 min of PU/silsesquioxane mixture is lower than that of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) and PU (two-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). Furthermore, SEM images show "island'' morphologic pattern with Cooper grades I platelet adsorption morphology on the smooth PU/silsesquioxane surface, and mechanic test shows that the samples with silsesquioxane mixture can increase mechanic property of PU. On the basis of these results, we conclude that this kind of nanocomposite has promise for application in biomaterials. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel biomaterial based on Ti-Si-Zr was developed using the sintering process with a composition targeting at a bulk modulus in the same range as that of human bone, i.e. 10-30 GPa. Control of porosity should also be possible to allow for the promotion osseointegration. The sintering procedure involves the use of mechanically alloyed Ti-Si-powder, and TiH2, to promote bonding, but not consolidation. The effect of porosity on the bulk modulus using compression testing is investigated. The influence of sintering temperature, heating rate, and amount and size of the TiH2-activator on porosity are also investigated. The achievable bulk modulus was in the range of 20-55 GPa at porosity levels ranging from 16% to 54%. Porosity had a profound influence on the bulk modulus, and the choice of appropriate processing conditions enables the creation of an engineered porosity and bulk modulus primarily by varying the sintering temperature and the size of the TiH2-powder particles.

TI Durability of Bioprosthetic Cardiac Valves
SO DEUTSCHES ARZTEBLATT INTERNATIONAL
AB Introduction: The choice of type of heart valve prosthesis is determined by the patient's age since bioprostheses have a limited lifespan. This article reviews current recommendations and the literature on cardiac valve replacement.
   Methods: Selective literature search in Medline/PubMed back to 1996 and review of current national and international recommendations from specialist societies.
   Results: The recommendations guiding the type of heart valve replacement have been revised in recent years. Of particular interest are the new generation of biological prostheses with extended durability, a growing use of stentless bioprostheses, a decrease in mortality of reoperation and an increase in life expectancy. Comorbidities such as chronic renal insufficiency or chronic atrial fibrillation are no longer contraindications to bioprosthesis. The number of heart valve replacements in recent years rose despite a concomitant increase in valve repairs. Aortic valves are being increasingly replaced by bioprostheses.
   Discussion: The choice of heart valve prosthesis should be tailored to each patient taking into account the patient's age, life expectancy, comorbidities, and life style. Different decisions may be made now than those based on earlier recommendations resulting in an individualized treatment, in patients over the age of 65 or 70.

TI Electrochemical actuation in chitosan/polyaniline microfibers for
   artificial muscles fabricated using an in situ polymerization
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB We have fabricated a new type of electroactuating biopolymer hydrogel/polyaniline microfiber by wet spinning a chitosan solution, followed by the in situ chemical polymerization of aniline. This novel biomaterial showed an enhanced chemical and electrochemical actuation in response to pH and an electrical stimulus. The fibers showed a reasonable electrical conductivity of 2.856 x 10(-2) S/cm at room temperature. The strain ratio and response time during electrochemical actuation were highly dependent on the pH of the electrolyte. An isotonic strain of 0.39% during electrochemical actuation in an aqueous HCl solution at pH = 0, along with a strain of 6.73% corresponding to pH actuation was realized in the microfibers. The higher strain ratio at lower pH values is probably due to a faster diffusion rate. Although the electrochemical actuation was due to the polyaniline, the actuation mechanism was different from that in pure polyaniline. EDX analysis showed the presence of polyaniline inside the fibers, which gradually decreased moving towards the center of the fiber. SEM images of the fibers showed an agglomerated granular morphology of polyaniline particles coated on the surface of the chitosan fibers. The electrochemical properties of the fibers were due to polyaniline, as evidenced by cyclic voltammogram. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Reduction of bacterial adhesion on modified DLC coatings
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES B-BIOINTERFACES
AB The high incidence of infections caused by the use of implanted biomedical devices, including catheters, bone fracture fixation pins and heart valves, etc. has a severe impact on human health and health care costs. Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films as biomaterial for medical devices have been attracting great interest due to their excellent properties such as low friction and chemical inertness. It has been demonstrated that the properties of DLC films can be further improved by the addition of selective elements into DLC films. In this paper Si- and N-doped DLC coatings with various silicon and nitrogen contents on 316 stainless steel substrates were prepared by a magnetron sputtering technique. Bacterial adhesion to the modified DLC coatings was evaluated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 33347) which frequently cause medical device infections. The results showed that the addition of N or Si in DLC coatings had a significant influence on bacterial adhesion. In general the modified DLC coatings with N or Si performed better than the pure DLC coatings in inhibiting bacterial adhesion. The bacterial adhesion mechanism on the modified DLC coatings was explained with thermodynamic theory. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Assessing adsorbent-biomass interactions during expanded bed adsorption
   onto ion exchangers utilizing surface energetics
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB Biomass adhesion onto an adsorbent matrix or "interaction" as well as biological particle co-adhesion or "aggregation" can severely affect the overall performance of many direct-contact methods for downstream processing of bioproducts. Studies to quantitatively describe this biomass-adsorbent interaction were developed utilizing surface energetics. An indirect thermodynamic approach via contact angle and zeta potential measurements was utilized. Intact yeast cells, yeast homogenates, and disrupted bacterial paste were employed as model system. Various surfaces that are relevant to biochemical and environmental applications were characterized. The extended Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, Overbeek (XDLVO) theory was found to appropriately predict biomass adhesion behaviour. It was observed that cell attachment onto anion-exchange supports is promoted by strong and close interaction within a secondary energy minimum followed by moderate multilayer cell aggregation. On the other hand, cell interaction with cation-exchange materials can take place within a reversible secondary energy minimum and at longer separation distance. The influence of particle charge and size, as well as the influence of the nature of the material under study were summarized in the form of energy vs. distance profiles. These investigations lead to many process-related conclusions: (a) process buffer conductivity windows can be recommended for anion-exchange chromatography (AEX) vs. cation-exchange chromatography (CEX) systems, (b) increased hydrodynamic shear is required to prevent biomass attachment onto AEX as compared to CEX, and (c) aggregation phenomena is a function of contact time and biomass concentration. Understanding biomass-adsorbent interaction at the particle (local) level is opening the pave for optimized operation of expanded bed adsorption methods at the process (macro) scale. A universal methodological approach is presented to guide both process and material design. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The effect of sodium chloride on molecular mobility in amorphous sucrose
   detected by phosphorescence from the triplet probe erythrosin B
SO CARBOHYDRATE RESEARCH
AB Phosphorescence from the triplet probe erythrosin B provides spectroscopic characteristics such as emission energy and lifetime that are specifically sensitive to molecular mobility of the local environment. This study used phosphorescence of erythrosin B to investigate how variation in NaCl content modulated the mobility of the amorphous sucrose matrix over the temperature range from 5 to 100 degrees C. Addition of NaCl increased the emission energy and the energy difference with excitation at the absorption maximum and the red edge, and increased the lifetime by reducing the non-radiative decay rate in the glass as well as in the undercooled liquid in a concentration dependent manner, indicating that NaCl decreased the matrix molecular mobility. Emission energy and lifetime increased with increasing NaCl content up to a maximum at NaCl/sucrose mole ratio of similar to 0.5; above 0.5 mole ratio, the effect of NaCl was less significant and appeared to be opposed by increasing plasticization by residual water. Changes in the width of the distribution of the emission energy and lifetime and variation in the lifetime with excitation and emission wavelength indicated that NaCl increased the spectral heterogeneity and thus increased the extent of dynamic site heterogeneity. These results are consistent with a physical model in which sodium and chloride ions interact with sucrose OH by ion-dipole interactions, forming clusters of less mobile molecules within the matrix.

TI Numerical modeling of a high pressure thawing process of a biomaterial
SO AICHE JOURNAL
AB A numerical model for predicting temperature and velocity fields during conjugate heat transfer in a high pressure (HP) (similar to 200 MPa) thawing process presented. This model considers the apparent specific heat formulation to solve the energy equation with phase change and the shift approach to extrapolate thermophysical properties at HP. It does not require the adjustement of the convective heat transfer coefficient. The compressible flow of water in the HP vessel is calculated. It is shown that the fluid motion is dominated by forced convection in the compression phase and by natural convection during the holding phase. A very good agreement between numerical and experimental results is obtained. Additional simulations carried out at various pressures permit to assess the influence of the pressure level on the thawing time. The analysis of the phase change inside the food and of the velocity field inside the vessel clearly demonstrates the great potential of this model to optimize this HP process at an industrial scale.

TI Functionality of endothelial cells on silk fibroin nets: Comparative
   study of micro- and nanometric fibre size
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Biomimetic material design, such as mimicking nanostructured components of the extracellular matrix, is an actual challenge for biomaterial research with a high impact on tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Thus, understanding the cellular response at the cell biological and molecular level and the consequences of various chemically or physically modified biomaterials is highly important. In the present study we assessed the response of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and outgrowth endothelial cells (OEC) from endothelial progenitor cells to different variants of nanofibrous silk fibroin nets in comparison to microfibrous silk fibroin scaffolds with regard to cellular morphology, proliferation, formation of intercellular contacts as well as integrin-dependent adhesion. Endothelial cells (ECs) grown on nanometric nets formed a differentiated and interconnected endothelial monolayer with no significant changes in the expression of intercellular contact molecules or proliferation rates compared with cells grown on micrornetric nets. Nevertheless, quantitative real-time PCR revealed a higher expression level of integrin-beta 1 in ECs grown on nanofibrous fibroin nets compared to the microfibrous samples. In addition, single nano-fibres were recognised by the integrin- receptor mechanism supporting the formation of focal adhesion at the interface of ECs and nanometric nets. These findings indicate that the nanometric silk fibroin scaffolds did not interfere with the formation of a differentiated and interconnected EC layer. On the contrary, nanofibre variation of the fibroin net architecture induced changes in ECs at the molecular level in terms of the increased expression of adhesion molecules such as integrin-beta 1.

TI Relevance of bi-functionalized polyelectrolyte multilayers for cell
   transfection
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB In an effort to develop new biomaterial coatings, it was shown that polyelectrolyte multilayers constitute a very powerful tool to render surfaces biologically active. The challenge is to multi-functionalize surfaces in a controlled way. We show here, for the first time, that it is possible to functionalize multilayer films simultaneously with two molecules acting in totally different ways on cells, namely plasmid DNA (pDNA), pre-complexed with poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), and a peptide molecule, NDPMSH. This peptide, grafted to poly (L-glutamic acid) (PGA) was used as a signal molecule for melamona cells B16-F1 and for its ability to enhance gene delivery in a receptor-independent manner. The PGA-NDPMSH chains are embedded in poly-(allylamine hydrochloride)/poly-(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) multilayers and the pDNA-PEI complexes are deposited on top of the films. It is shown that melanoma cells (B16-F1) are efficiently transfected after 24h of contact with functionalized films. When brought in contact with Huh-7 cells that do not express the peptide receptors, these films trigger significantly the transfection rate, showing that it is possible to enhance the transfection process by incorporating specific peptides into multilayer films. Moreover, transfected cells sorted by flow cytometry produce melanin, demonstrating both activation via the peptide signaling pathway and cell transfection. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI The effect of hyaluronic acid on silk fibroin conformation
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The molecular conformation of silk fibroin drastically changes the physical properties of this biomaterial. Herein, we investigated the capacity of hyaluronic acid to modify the conformational transition of silk fibroin into its crystalline beta-sheet form. For this aim, matrices composed of these two polymers were prepared and studied. Instrumental analysis confirmed the presence of two intermixed phases: one of pure hyaluronic acid, and another consisting of a molecular dispersion of silk fibroin and hyaluronic acid. Studies performed with silk fibroin/hyaluronic acid matrices indicated that hyaluronic acid induces molecular transition of silk fibroin into a beta-sheet structure when incubated in water, and that it synergistically enhances beta-sheet formation together with methanol treatment. The enhancement of beta-sheet content observed for silk fibroin/hyaluronic acid matrices correlated with improved mechanical properties: blended matrices had higher compressive moduli and higher breaking strengths than pure silk fibroin matrices. These new properties, together with the capacity of silk fibroin/hyaluronic acid to form partially insoluble matrices without any treatment with organic solvents, make this blend composition an interesting material for biomedical applications.

TI Biphasic scaffold for annulus fibrosus tissue regeneration
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is the major cause of lower back pain, while the currently available treatments are symptomatic rather than curative. Tissue engineering is a powerful therapeutic strategy that can restore the normal biomechanical motion of the human spine. The ability of a biphasic elastic scaffold to structurally and elastically simulate the annulus fibrosus (AF) tissue of the IVD was explored. The outer phase of the scaffold was a ring-shaped denineralized bone matrix gelatin (BMG) extracted from cortical bone, which mimicks the type I collagen structure and ligamentous properties of outer AF. The inner phase of the scaffold was a bio-biomaterial poly(polycaprolactone triol malate) (PPCLM) orientated in concentric sheets and seeded with chondrocytes to recapitulate the inner layer of the AF, which is rich in type II collagen and proteoglycan. The mechanical properties and degradation of PPCLM could be adjusted by controlling the post-polymerization time of the pre-polymer. PPCLM also demonstrated good biocompatibility in a foreign body response in vivo assay. Incorporation of BMG into the scaffold enhanced the compressive strength compared with PPCLM alone. In addition, the tensile stress of the BMG/PPCLM scaffold was 50-fold greater than that of PPCLM alone, and close to that of normal rabbit AF. Finally, the biphasic scaffold supported the growth of rabbit chondrocytes, as confirmed by Safranin-O and type 11 collagen immunostaining. The excellent mechanical properties and biocompatibility of the BMG/PPCLM scaffold make it a promising candidate for AF repair. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Influence of intraocular lens material on the development of acute
   endophthalmitis after cataract surgery?
SO EYE
AB Purpose To investigate the causal relationship between acute postoperative endophthalmitis (POE) after cataract surgery and the biomaterial properties of the intraocular lens (IOLs) implanted.
   Methods This retrospective cohort study included all patients who had undergone cataract surgery with IOL implantation at the Lyon Croix-Rousse University Hospital between 1st January 1994 and 31st December 2004. Details respecting the type of IOL implanted (material and manufacturer) were meticulously recorded. The number of patients presenting with POE within 6 weeks of cataract surgery was documented together with their medical characteristics. These data were then compared, and Fisher's exact test was used to establish the significance of any apparent associations.
   Results Eight of the 5837 eyes manifested acute POE (0.14%). Seven of these were composed of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and one of heparinized PMMA. Patients with PMMA IOLs carried a higher risk of developing POE than did those implanted with either heparinized PMMA (P=0.001), hydrophilic acrylic, or hydrophobic acrylic IOLs (P=0.002).
   Conclusions The incidence of acute POE after cataract surgery in our hospital is similar to that currently reported for other institutions in developed countries. Our results add further evidence that IOL material and type are factors contributing to the risk to develop an acute POE after cataract surgery, and that PMMA IOLs may be associated with an increased risk of POE.

In this study, electrical discharge of the fibers exposed to different voltages for certain periods was examined and mechanical lifetime was measured and also the structure parameters U-o and gamma were calculated. We observed that crosslinks might be formed at the silk fibers exposed to high voltages and as a result, fibers become more resistant to mechanical effects.

TI In vitro study of axonal migration and myelination of motor neurons in a
   three-dimensional tissue-engineered model
SO GLIA
AB Primary motor neurons are difficult to study in conventional culture systems because of their short-term survival without trophic support from glia. In addition, axonal migration on a two-dimensional Petri dish does not reflect the three-dimensional (3D) environment in vivo. A unique in vitro 3D model of motor nerve regeneration was developed to study motor neuron axonal migration and myelination. Mouse spinal cord motor neurons were seeded on a collagen sponge populated with Schwann cells and fibroblasts. This fibroblast-populated sponge was intended to mimic the connective tissue through which motor axons have to elongate in vivo. Addition of conventional neurotrophic supplements was not required for motor neuron survival but was necessary to promote deep neurite outgrowth, as assessed by immunostaining of neurofilament M. A vigorous neurite elongation was detected inside the sponge after only 14 days of neuron culture, reaching more than 850 mu m. The model also allowed the maturation of motor fibers as one-third of them were positive for neurofilament H. Neurites growing in the sponge were subject to myelination when Schwann cells were present, as shown by myelin basic protein immunostaining and electron microscopy. We demonstrated in this model the spontaneous formation of numerous thick myelin sheaths surrounding motor fibers after long-term culture (28 days). Thus, this model might be a valuable tool to study the effect of various cells and/or attractive or repulsive molecules on motor neurite outgrowth in vitro and also for the study of myelination and pathogenesis of motor neuron diseases.

CL Tokyo, JAPAN
AB Surface designing of substrate to regulate cell adhesion and function in nano and micro scale is a critical issue in biomaterial science. In this study, we describe the fabrication of highly regular patterned porous films (honeycomb-patterned film) formed by a simply casting technique, and the culture of mature hepatocytes and small hepatocytes on the films. The pore size of the honeycomb-patterned films used was 6, 12, and 16 pm. We evaluated the effect of the honeycomb-patterned films on the morphology, cell yield, survival and the differentiated hepatic function (albumin production) of the both hepatocytes. Both hepatocytes attached on the flat films appeared to spread well, showing a typical monolayer morphology. They peeled off from the films at 7 days in culture on the flat films. On the other hand, spreading of the each hepatocytes was restricted on the honeycomb-patterned films at 3 and 7 days in culture. The cell yield and survival of the each hepatocytes increased with increasing culture time. Small hepatocyte on the pore sizes of 16 pm showed the highest cell yield (approximately 3 times). Albumin production of mature hepatocyte on the pore sizes of 16 mu m (224.1.3 +/- 157 ng ml(-1) well(-1) at 1 day in culture, 369.5 +/- 222 ng ml(-1) well(-1) at 3 days in culture) was higher than that of the hepatocytes on the flat films (119.3 +/- 9.3 ng ml(-1) well(-1) at 1 day in culture, 262.8 +/- 47.3 ng ml(-1) well(-1) at 3 days in culture), although that of small hepatocytes on the honeycomb-patterned films (pore size: 16 mu m) was similar on the flat film. These results indicated that both the surface topography and the pore size of the honeycomb-patterned film affected the hepatic metabolic function.

TI Alginate/lactose-modified chitosan hydrogels: A bioactive biomaterial
   for chondrocyte encapsulation
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB A new bioactive scaffold was prepared from a binary polysaccharide mixture composed of a polyanion (alginate) and a polycation (a lactose-modified chitosan, chitlac). Its potential use for articular chondrocytes encapsulation and cartilage reconstructive surgery applications has been studied. The hydrogel combines the ability of alginate to act as a 3D supporting structure with the capability of the second component (chitlac) to provide interactions with porcine articular chondrocytes. Physico-chemical characterization of the scaffold was accomplished by gel kinetics and compression measurements and demonstrated that alginate-chitlac mixture (AC-mixture) hydrogels exhibit better mechanical properties when compared with sole alginate hydrogels. Furthermore, biochemical and biological studies showed that these 3D scaffolds are able to maintain chondrocyte phenotype and particularly to significantly stimulate and promote chondrocyte growth and proliferation. In conclusion, the present study can be considered as a first step towards an engineered, biologically active scaffold for chondrocyte in vitro cultivation, expansion, and cell delivery.

SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the response of osteoblastic cells to the composite of Ricinus cominunis polyurethane (RCP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) incubated in synthetic body fluid (SBF). RCP pure (RCPp) and RCP blended with ALP 6 mg/mL polymer (RCP+ALP) were incubated in SBF for 17 days. Four groups of RCP were tested: RCPp, RCP+ALP, and RCPp and RCP+ALP incubated in SBF (RCPp/SBF and RCP+ALP/SBF). Stem cells from rat bone marrow were cultured in conditions that allowed osteoblastic differentiation on RCP discs and were evaluated: cell adhesion, culture growth, cell viability, total protein content, ALP activity, and bone-like nodule formation. Data were compared by ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test. The group RCP-A P was highly cytotoxic and, therefore, was not considered here. Cell adhesion (p = 0.14), culture growth (p = 0.39), viability (p = 0.46) and total protein content (p = 0.12) were not affected by either RCP composition or incubation in SBE ALP activity was affected (p = 0.0001) as follows: RCPp < RCPp/SBF < RCP+ALP/SBF. Bone-like nodule formation was not observed on all evaluated groups. The composite RCP+ALP prior to SBF incubation is cytotoxic and must not be considered as biomaterial, but the incorporation of ALP to the RCP followed by SBF incubation could be a useful alternative to improve the biological properties of the RCP.

TI Preparation of fibroin/recombinant human-like collagen scaffold to
   promote fibroblasts compatibility
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Recombinant human-like collagen (RHLC) was added to fibroin solution to prepare a novel hybrid scaffold material for skin tissue engineering. The morphology of the scaffold had highly homogeneous and interconnected pores with pore sizes 136 +/- 32 mu m measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). FTIR analysis indicated intermolecular crosslinkages between fibroin and RHLC formed. The viscosity of the blend solution increased because of the interaction between fibroin and RHLC, and then it restrained the unwanted fibroin aggregation in freezing process that generally appeared in fibroin scaffold preparation with freeze drying method. After methanol treatment the fibroin/RHLC scaffold became water-stable. The porosity of scaffolds was >90%, the compressive strength and modulus were up to 662 +/- 32 KPa and 7.8 +/- 0.64 MPa, respectively. Fibroblasts cultured within fibroin/RHLC scaffolds were investigated by SEM, laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), and MTT assay, which showed that the adding of RHLC significantly enhanced the cells adhesion, proliferation, and viability compare with fibroin scaffolds. These results suggest that the hybrid scaffolds have favorable characteristics for skin tissue engineering. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Genetic effect of zirconium oxide coating on osteoblast-like cells
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS
AB Zirconium is widely used as material for prosthetic devices because its good mechanical and chemical properties. When exposed to oxygen, zirconium becomes zirconium oxide (ZrO2), which is biocompatible. ZrO2 can be also prepared as a colloidal suspension and then used to coat surfaces. Zirconium oxide coating (ZrO2C) can potentially have specific biologic effects, and among them is bone formation related to implant osseointegration. How this biomaterial alters osteoblast activity to promote bone formation is poorly understood. We therefore attempted to address this question by using microarray techniques to identify genes that are differently regulated in osteoblasts exposed to ZrO2C. By using DNA microarrays containing 20,000 genes, we identified in osteoblast-like cell lines (MG-63) cultured with ZrO2C several genes whose expression was significantly upregulated or downregulated. The differentially expressed genes cover a broad range of functional activities: (a) cell cycle regulation, (b) signal transduction, (c) immunity, and (d) cytoskeleton component. The data reported are, to our now knowledge, the first genetic portrait of ZrO2C effects. They can be relevant to better understand the molecular mechanism of bone regeneration and as a model for comparing other materials with similar clinical effects. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Haptide-coated collagen sponge as a bioactive matrix for tissue
   regeneration
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS
AB We previously described a new class of conserved, cell adhesive (haptotactic) peptides, termed Haptides, based on sequences first identified in fibrinogen. Here, we describe a new biomaterial, Haptide-coated Collagen, in which the carbodiimide reagent, EDC, was used to covalently couple a Haptide (preC gamma), equivalent to the carboxy terminus of the fibrinogen gamma chain, to a cross-linked sponge composed of bovine collagen type I. The dose response of Haptide bound to collagen on cell attachment response reached a plateau at a concentration of 5-10 mg Haptide/g collagen. The Haptized-collagen was more stable to 1N NaOH, with a degradation half-time (T-1/2) of 1.7 h, compared to 0.9 h for untreated control. Haptized collagen discs could be loaded with similar to 30% more human dermal fibroblasts or bovine aortic endothelial cells than unmodified collagen discs (p < 0.001). After a proliferation phase, Haptized collagen discs contained similar to 45% more fibroblasts than non-Haptized discs (p < 0.01). Histological analysis following sub-dermal implantation in rats, indicated that at day 8, Haptized collagen sponge was less degraded than unmodified collagen sponge, attracted more endogenous fibroblasts with newly deposited collagen, and provoked less inflammatory or other adverse reactions. These results suggest potential clinical applications for Haptized collagen sponge for tissue regeneration, soft tissue augmentation, skin repair, and wound healing. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Novel precursor-derived Si-C-N ceramic material for purification
   application
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB Metagenomic DNA (gDNA) is an important research topic because uncultivated microorganisms represent an interesting reservoir of genes with potential biotechnological applications. Here we describe a novel Si-C-N chromatography approach of gDNA extraction from environmental samples. Amorphous Si-C-N ceramic was obtained by the pyrolysis of a polymer precursor (polycarbosilazane) at 1350 degrees C in Ar. The purified gDNA fragments were at least 12 kilo base pairs in size and were sufficiently free of contaminants, thus were applicable to both restriction enzyme digestion using five different enzymes and polymerase chain reaction amplification for detecting phylogenetic groups of native microorganisms in environmental samples. This Si-C-N material produces pure gDNA that can be utilized in some of the most common molecular biological procedures applied in the purification step. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Enamel matrix derivative and low-level laser therapy in the treatment of
   intra-bony defects: a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PERIODONTOLOGY
AB Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the immediate post-operative pain, wound healing and clinical results after the application of an enamel matrix protein derivative (EMD) alone or combined with a low-level laser therapy (LLLT) for the treatment of deep intra-bony defects.
   Material and Methods: This study was an intra-individual longitudinal test of 12 months' duration conducted using a blinded, split-mouth, placebo-controlled and randomized design. In 22 periodontitis patients, one intra-bony defect was randomly treated with EMD + LLLT, while EMD alone was applied to the contra-lateral defect site. LLLT was used both intra- and post-operatively. Clinical measurements were performed by a blinded periodontist at the time of surgery, in the first week and in the first, second, sixth and 12th month. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were recorded for pain assesment.
   Results: The results have shown that the treatment of intra-bony defects with EMD alone or EMD + LLLT leads to probing depth reduction and attachment-level gain. In addition, EMD + LLLT had resulted in less gingival recession (p < 0.05), less swelling (p < 0.001) and less VAS scores (p < 0.02) compared with EMD alone.
   Conclusion: This study shows that EMD is an effective, safe and predictable biomaterial for periodontal regeneration and LLLT may improve the effects of EMD by reducing post-operative complications.

TI Preparation of three-dimensional fibroin/collagen scaffolds in various
   pH conditions
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB Three dimensional (3-D) fibroin/collagen scaffolds are the novel fibroin based scaffolds derived from aqueous solution. In this article, we investigated the effect of pH on the formation of fibroin/collagen scaffolds. In the range of pH from 4 to 8.5, the fibroin/collagen scaffolds with good porous structures can be prepared using freeze-drying method, which would facilitate the adding of other biopolymers. The structures of different fibroin-based scaffolds were investigated with FTIR and DSC, which indicated that the interaction of fibroin and collagen affected the methanol-induced transformation of fibroin from random-coil to beta-sheet conformation. The mechanical properties were also studied. The results mean that all the fibroin-based scaffolds prepared in various pH values had better mechanical properties than other reported fibroin scaffolds. Since the fibroin/collagen scaffolds can be prepared in the range of pH from 4 to 8.5, it is very easy to prepare different multifunctional scaffolds such as fibroin/collagen/chitosan scaffolds and fibroin/collagen/heparin scaffolds in acidic or neutral conditions. These new fibroin-based blend materials extend the range of biomaterial properties that can promote the use in biomedical applications such as drug release and tissue engineering.

TI In vitro biocompatibility of degradable biopolymers in cell line
   cultures from various ocular tissues: extraction studies
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB In vitro biocompatibility of 50:50 PDLGA, 85:15 PDLGA, and Inion GTR (TM) membrane was evaluated in cell line cultures from various ocular tissues, in human corneal epithelial cells (HCE), rabbit stromal fibroblasts (SIRC), bovine corneal endothelial cells (BCE), human conjunctival epithelial cells (IOBA-NHC), and human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19). To study the toxicity of degradation products, the biomaterials were extracted in phosphate buffered saline at 70 degrees C for 24 h. The cell cultures were exposed to biomaterial extract diluted in medium (1:1-1:8) and the biocompatibility was evaluated by the WST-1 cytotoxicity/cell proliferation test. In all experiments without pH neutralization, cell viability increased with decreasing biomaterial extract volume. The highest extraction ratio 1:1 of PDLGA 50:50 decreased viability from 5-20%, from the control level, depending on the cell type. The corresponding cell viability values for PDLGA 85:15 and Inion GTR membrane ranged from 47-87% and 66-92%, respectively. When the pH of biomaterial extract was neutralized, Inion GTR membrane and PDLGA 85:15 had no effect on viability. BCE, HCE, and IOBA-NHC appeared to the most sensitive cell types, while SIRC and ARPE-19 were more resistant. The results of our in vitro studies suggest that the polymers tested are satisfactorily biocompatible.

TI Effect of filler surface morphology on the impact behaviour of
   hydroxyapatite reinforced high density polyethylene composites
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB Instrumented falling weight impact tests have been carried out to characterize the impact behaviour of hydroxyapatite reinforced high-density polyethylene composite (HA-HDPE) in order to use this biomaterial in skull implants. The effects of HA filler surface morphology and volume fraction on the fracture toughness were studied, and fracture mechanism investigated. Impact resistance was found to be markedly improved by using a sintered grade HA filler with smooth particle surface instead of spray dried grade HA with rough surface. SEM examination of impacted fracture surfaces revealed that the improvement of impact resistance was due to the stronger interfacial bonding between smooth HA particles and HDPE polymer matrix compared with that between rough HA and HDPE, which results in more energy absorption during impact and hence better fracture resistance.

TI In vitro osteogenesis on fluorcanasite glass-ceramic with three
   different chemical compositions
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB This study aimed at investigating in vitro osteogenesis on three fluorcanasite glass-ceramic compositions with different solubilities (K3, K5, and K8). Osteoblastic cells were obtained from human alveolar bone fragments and cultured under standard osteogenic condition until subconfluence. First passage cells were cultured on K3, K5, and K8 and on Bioglass (R) 45S5 (45S5-control). Cell adhesion was evaluated at 24 h. For proliferation and viability, cells were cultured for 1, 4, and 10 days. Total protein content and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were measured at 7, 14, and 21 days. Cultures were stained with Alizarin red at 21 days, for detection of mineralized matrix. Data were compared by ANOVA followed by Duncan's test. Cell adhesion, cell proliferation, viability, total protein content, and ALP activity were not affected by fluorcanasite glass-ceramic composition and solubility. Bone-like formation was similar on all fluorcanasite-glass ceramics and was reduced compared to 45S5. The changes in the chemical composition and consequently solubility of the fluorcanasite glass-ceramics tested here did not significantly alter the in vitro osteogenesis. Further modifications of the chemical composition of the fluorcanasite glass-ceramic would be required to improve bone response, making this biomaterial a good candidate to be employed as a bone substitute.

Reaction between glucose and cupric sulphate is also evident by conductivity measurements which showed a decrease in electrical conductivity on addition of glucose. There was also a decrease in glucose concentration on addition of cupric sulphate. Glucose crystallizes as fractal in agar-agar matrix, which on addition of cupric sulphate crystallizes rhythmically. Surface morphology of the product was studied by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), which revealed the formation of nanosized material. The average thickness of the particle aggregates was in the range of 50-115 nm.

TI Ureteral stenting and urinary stone management: A systematic review
SO JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
AB Purpose: Ureteral stents are widely used in many urological procedures. We evaluated the recent literature, providing an update on materials and stent designs, and indications for stent placement and stent complications, including the management of such stent related problems.
   Materials and Methods: A thorough literature search on ureteral stents was performed. Pertinent new and review/updated articles published in the English literature from 2000 through 2006 were systematically reviewed.
   Results: Following uncomplicated ureteroscopy or shock wave lithotripsy routine stenting does not appear to affect the stone-free rate. However, stent related morbidity is often seen. Patients at greatest risk for complications are those undergoing bilateral stentless ureteroscopy, those with recent or recurrent urinary tract infections and pregnant patients. The placement of indwelling stents in these patients should be considered. The development of stent materials and designs has been directed toward decreasing stent related morbidity, such as pain, discomfort, bladder irritability, infection and encrustation. Changes in stent design and materials show great promise. Initial evaluations suggest improvements in patient comfort as well as decreased encrustation. Forgotten stents can lead to significant morbidity as a result of severe encrustation. Most cases can be managed endoscopically, often requiring multiple procedures.
   Conclusions: Stenting is not mandatory after uncomplicated simple ureteroscopy and shock wave lithotripsy. Patients with stents seem to have significantly more bladder and lower urinary tract symptoms than those in whom stents are not placed. However, there is a subgroup of patients who likely benefit from stenting following a procedure because of the increased risk of complications. The ideal ureteral stent biomaterial has yet to be discovered and an area of promising development is the drug eluting stent to prevent infection and encrustation.

   alloys with combination of N addition and Cr-enrichment
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB An improvement in the mechanical properties of a biomedical Ni-free Co-Cr-Mo alloy under as-cast condition has been examined by means of tensile tests and microstructure observations. The solubility of N in Co-Cr-Mo alloys increases with increasing Cr content from 29 to 34 mass%. This results in a significant improvement in mechanical properties such as yield stress, tensile strength, and fracture elongation. The improvement in the mechanical properties results from the gamma phase stabilization and inhibition of the a phase formation due to N addition. Increasing the Cr content also has contributed to the improved mechanical properties.

TI Preparation and the phase transformation behavior of amorphous
   mesoporous calcium silicate
SO MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS
AB Calcium silicate is not only an important substance in the ceramic and cement industries but also a novel biomaterial for bone repair due to the good bioactivity and degradability/resolvability. In this study, the well-ordered amorphous mesoporous calcium silicate (MCS) was synthesized and its abnormal phase transformation behavior was investigated. The results illustrated an abnormal phase transformation phenomenon of CaSiO3, which was closely related to the mesoporous structure of the materials. When the amorphous mesoporous calcium silicate was calcined, the low-temperature phase beta-CaSiO3 did not appear with the increase of the temperature and high-temperature phase alpha-CaSiO3 was obtained at 800 degrees C, which was 325 degrees C lower than the normal temperature for the formation of alpha-CaSiO3. Our results indicated that mesoporous structure could influence the phase transformation behavior of materials, which can effectively decrease the preparation temperature of high-temperature ceramics.

TI Baculovirus expression and bioactivity of a soluble 140 kDa
   extracellular cleavage fragment of L1 neural cell adhesion molecule
SO PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION
AB L1 neural cell adhesion molecule is the founding member of the L1 subfamily of the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays an important role in the overall development of both the central and peripheral nervous systems, making it an attractive candidate for promoting neural regeneration following injury. Currently, L1 used for experimental studies is primarily mammalian-derived; however, the insect cell expression system described here provides an alternative source of recombinant L1 with equivalent bioactivity. A 140 kDa L1 fragment based on a physiological plasmin cleavage site in the extracellular domain was cloned and expressed with a C-terminal 6x histidine tag. Recombinant insect cell-derived L1 was analyzed by Western blot using an antibody to human L1 to confirm immunogenicity and to optimize infection conditions for recombinant L1 production. The recombinant protein was secreted by insect cells, efficiently purified under non-denaturing conditions using dialysis followed by metal affinity chromatography, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE to produce a single band of the expected approximate 140 kDa size. The bioactivity of insect cell-derived L1 was compared to mammalian-derived L1-Fc and poly-L-lysine (PLL) using chick embryonic forebrain neurons. The results show comparable, robust neurite outgrowth at 24 h on insect cell-derived L1 and mammalian-derived L1-Fc, with significantly longer neurites than those observed on PLL. Future studies will examine the immobilization of L1 to biomaterial surfaces in physiologically appropriate orientation via the C-terminal 6x histidine tag and will investigate their application in promoting axonal regeneration in the injured nervous system.

TI MEASUREMENT AND INTERPRETATION OF WETTING PROPERTIES OF NEW
   COLLAGEN-SILICATE BIOMATERIAL
SO REVUE ROUMAINE DE CHIMIE
AB New nontoxic, biocompatible, collagen-natural silicate membranes were prepared. The morphology of nanostructured materials (partially exfoliated, exfoliated or intercalated) depends on the preparation method. The incorporation of a bioactive drug (gentamycine) in the silicate before the membranes casting induces an intercalated nanostructure. The used silicate was montmorillonite, a purified natural bentonite (Bentonite of Chioar Valley Roumania). Through contact angle measurements of membrane/air and membrane/polyethylene support, the surface tension (gamma(s)), electron acceptor (gamma(+)(s)) and electron donor (gamma(-)(s)) surface components of biomaterial samples were calculated using the Lifishitzvan der Waals/Lewis acid-base interaction model. The dynamic contact angle was used to determine the surface porosity, partial soaking and the rate of water diffusion in the membrane, which was found to reflect the nanostructured morphology.
   The nanocomposite morphology was studied using X-Ray diffraction and SEM methods whose results are in good agreement with the wettability data. The new membranes are promising transdermal biomaterials.

SO TOXICOLOGY IN VITRO
AB The aims of this study are to determine the mutagenicity of a locally produced polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) using Salmonella mutagenicity test and to find out if PHB altered the expression of p53 and c-myc proto-oncogenes and bcl-xl and bcl-xs anti-apoptotic genes in the human fibroblast cell line, MRC-5. Different concentrations of PHB were incubated with special genotypic variants of Salmonella strains (TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98 and TA100) carrying mutations in several genes both with and without metabolic activation (S9) and the test was assessed based on the number of revertant colonies. The average number of revertant colonies per plate treated with PHB was less than double as compared to that of negative control. For the gene expression analyses, fibroblast cell lines were treated with PHB at different concentrations and incubated for 1, 12, 24 and 48 It separately. The total RNA was isolated and analysed for the expression of p53, c-myc, bcl-xl and bcl-xs genes. The PHB did not show over or under expression of the genes studied. The above tests indicate that the locally produced PHB is non-genotoxic and does not alter the expression of the proto-oncogenes and anti-apoptotic genes considered in this study.

TI Biosorption of heavy metals and radionuclide from aqueous solutions by
   pre-treated arca shell biomass
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB In this study biosorption potential of pre-treated arca shell biomass for lead, copper, nickel, cobalt and cesium was explored from the artificially prepared solution containing known amount of metals. The effects of pH, initial concentration, biosorbent dosage and contact time were studied in batch experiments. Effects of common ions like sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium on the sorption capacity of pre-treated arca biomasses were also studied. To analyse the homogeneity of the biomaterial, experiments were performed for eight lots arca shell biomass for all the studies elements and it was observed that relative standard deviation in uptake capacity was within 10% for all elements. At equilibrium, the maximum total uptake by shell biomaterial was 18.33 +/- 0.44, 17.64 +/- 0.31, 9.86 +/- 0.17, 3.93 +/- 0.11 and 7.82 +/- 0.36 mg/g for lead, copper, nickel, cesium and cobalt, respectively, under the optimised condition of pH, initial concentration, biosorbent dose and contact time. Effect of all the common ions jointly up to concentration of 50 ppm was negligible for all the elements but at higher levels the cations affects the uptake capacity. Sorption isotherms were studied to explain the removal mechanism of both elements by fitting isotherms data into Lagergren, Freundlich and Langmuir equations. Halls separation factor estimated under optimised condition also favours the sorption potential of these elements using area shell biomass. Arca shell biomass can be effectively and efficiently employed for removal of studied elements after optimisation of parameters. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI In situ synthesis and photoluminescence of QD-CdS on silk fibroin fibers
   at room temperature
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB A convenient room-temperature bioinspired technique has been developed to synthesize hybrid nanocomposites consisting of well-dispersed CdS quantum dots (QD) and the substrate silk fibroin fibers (SFF). The biomaterial SFF provides both a supporting substrate and functional sites for the in situ generation of QD-CdS, which is supported by FTIR and PL measurements. The solid QD-CdS/SFF nanocomposites could be useful in photocatalyst, novel luminescence and photoelectron transfer devices. The QD-CdS/silk fibroin (SF) colloid, in which SF acts as both an inherent biocompatibilizer and an efficient passivator of trap sites on the QD-CdS surface, is also available for some potential applications in the biological fields. The bioinspired method and relevant ideas could extend to fabricating other functional hybrid materials.

TI Template-assembled triple-helical peptide molecules: Mimicry of collagen
   by molecular architecture and integrin-specific cell adhesion
SO BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Most proteins fold into specific structures to exert their biological functions, and therefore the creation of protein-like molecular architecture is a fundamental prerequisite toward realizing a novel biologically active protein-like biomaterial. To do this with an artificial collagen, we have engineered a peptide template characterized by its collagen-like primary structure composed of Gly-Phe-Gly-Glu-Glu-Gly sequence to assemble (Pro-Hyp-Gly)(n) (n = 3 and 5) into triple-helical conformations that resemble the native structure of collagen. The peptide template has three carboxyl groups connected to the N-termini of three collagen peptides. The coupling was accomplished by a simple and direct branching protocol without complex strategies. A series of biophysical studies, including melting curve analyses and CD and NMR spectroscopy, demonstrated the presence of stable triple-helical conformation in the template-assembled. (Pro-Hyp-Gly)(3) and (Pro-Hyp-Gly)(5) solution. Conversely, nontemplated peptides showed no evidence of assembly of triple-helical structure. A cell binding sequence (Gly-Phe-Hyp-Gly-Glu-Arg) derived from the collagen alpha(1)(I) chain was incorporated to mimic the integrin-specific cell adhesion of collagen. Cell adhesion and inhibition assays and immunofluorescence staining revealed a correlation of triple-helical conformation with cellular recognition of collagen mimetics in an integrin-specific way. This study offers a robust strategy for engineering native-like peptide-based biomaterials, fully composed of only amino acids, by maintaining protein conformation integrity and biological activity.

TI Use of a biomaterial as a thickener for textile ink-jet printing
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB The feasibility of using chitosan as a thickener in the pretreatment print paste for textile ink-jet printing was explored. An orthogonal analysis was used to determine the optimum conditions for using chitosan as a thickener in the pretreatment print paste and the effects of different process factors for achieving the best color yield in textile ink-jet printing. With the help of the orthogonal analysis, the importance of different process factors was found to be in the order of (1) the amount of urea used, (2) the amount of chitosan used, (3) the amount of sodium bicarbonate used, and (4) the steaming time. On the basis of the results of the orthogonal analysis, the optimum conditions for using chitosan as a thickener for the pretreatment print paste were concluded to be 40 mL of chitosan, 10 g of urea, 8 g of sodium bicarbonate, and 5 min of steaming. According to an analysis of the results of different color fastness tests, chitosan could principally work as a pretreatment print paste thickener. However, the final color yield obtained from chitosan-containing cotton fabrics depended greatly on the stage of the chitosan application. Nevertheless, the color fastness properties and the outline sharpness of the prints of cotton fabric were greatly improved by the chitosan treatment. A two-bath chitosan treatment was developed to separate the chitosan from sodium bicarbonate and urea before it was padded onto the fabric surface to minimize the neutralization effect. On the basis of the results for the highest color yield obtained on the cotton fabric, it was confirmed that the two-bath chitosan treatment was successfully developed. In addition, chitosan could impart higher antibacterial properties with a slight reduction in the tensile strength of the cotton fabric. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Biomimetic materials for tissue engineering
SO ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS
AB Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is an exciting research area that aims at regenerative alternatives to harvested tissues for transplantation. Biomaterials play a pivotal role as scaffolds to provide three-dimensional templates and synthetic extracellular matrix environments for tissue regeneration. It is often beneficial for the scaffolds to mimic certain advantageous characteristics of the natural extracellular matrix, or developmental or wound healing programs. This article reviews current biomimetic materials approaches in tissue engineering. These include synthesis to achieve certain compositions or properties similar to those of the extracellular matrix, novel processing technologies to achieve structural features mimicking the extracellular matrix on various levels, approaches to emulate cell-extracellular matrix interactions, and biologic delivery strategies to recapitulate a signaling cascade or developmental/wound healing program. The article also provides examples of enhanced cellular/tissue functions and regenerative outcomes, demonstrating the excitement and significance of the biomimetic materials for tissue engineering and regeneration.

TI Polymeric crystallization and condensation of calcium polyphosphate
   glass
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN
AB Calcium polyphosphate (Ca(PO3)(2))(n) (CPP) is under investigation as a resorbable bone biomaterial. Sintering CPP glass particles in humid air produces a porous, interconnected, degradable, crystalline construct that is suitable for connective tissue engineering applications. Porous CPP constructs sintered at 585 degrees C dissolved in water more rapidly than those sintered at 950 degrees C. FTIR, P-31 NMR. powder XRD, and density data for CPP glass and fully crystalline fibers were compared with data for the as-sintered and partially dissolved constructs sintered at 585 or 950 degrees C. The results suggest that condensation continues during sintering, and CPP glass crystallizes in a process analogous to the crystallization of linear organic polymers. During sintering, water vapor caused hydrolytic degradation of the surface polyphosphate chains, forming a surface layer with different dissolution properties than the particle interior. Thus, sintering CPP glass results in a heterogeneous crystalline product that impacts the dissolution rate of CPP as a degradable biomaterial. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A common problem for implants is the stress and the strain at the interface of implant and tissue. The reason for are different mechanical properties of biomaterial and tissue. This mechanical incompatibility might lead to the loosening of the implant. There are several strategies dealing with improving the interface of biomaterial and implants. Here we present data of the architecture of a natural interface that might serve to develop advanced surfaces for solid implants.
   From partially decalcified human tali the cartilage could be peeled off. Both, the cartilage and the bone were investigated by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM). The images give an impression of the roughness and structure of the interface. The resulting three dimensional pictures were quantified by the help of quantitative image analyse software. The quantitative analyse gives information about the real interface area, which is higher than the planar geometrical area, the ratio of bone and cartilage of the transition zone, and about the morphological structure of the interface.
   Quantitative data on the amount and structure of the graded interface can be used to model the mechanical properties of the interface and finally might help to create a micro design of the implant surface ideal for osteointegration and optimal load transfer.

AB Autologous pericardium, for repair of congenital heart defects, can be used in its fresh non-treated state, or after chemical fixation with glutaraldehyde solution as a biomaterial for surgical repair of congenital heart anomalies. The aim of this experimental study is to investigate changes of biornechanical properties and resistance to proteolytic degradation of human pericardium, after harvesting with glutaraldehyde solution.
   After taken out of a pericardiurn from anterior part of pericardial sac at the time of operation it was fixed with 0.2% solution of glutaraldehyde for 6 minutes.
   Some glutaraldehyde treated and untreated samples were incubated in collagenase solution (100 Uml(-1) for 2 hours at 37 degrees C and proteolytic effect was estimated with gravimetric method. For investigation of biornechanical properties uniaxial tensile tests were performed with testing machine Zwick-Roell Z010. There were set up 18 pieces of fresh human pericardium and 11 pieces of glutaraidehyde-treated human pericardium. There is difference (p<0.05) of ultimate strain (epsilon(max)) between fresh pericardium epsilon(max)=0.119 +/- 0.037 and glutaraldehyde treated human pericardium epsilon(max)=0.098 +/- 0.015, respectively.
   There is difference (p<0.05) of ultimate stress (sigma(max)) between non-treated pericardiurn sigma(max)=3.114 +/- 0.70 MP9 and glutaraldehyde treated human pericardium sigma(max)=6.20 +/- 11.47 MPa. There is difference (p<0.05) of tangential modulus of elasticity (E) between non-treated and glutaraldehyde treated human pericardium: 98.67 +/- 20.75 MPa and 50.25 +/- 16.04 MPa, respectively. Gravimetric data demonstrated that glutaraldehyde treatment resulted in statistically significant improvement in resistance of human pericardium to proteolytic degradation.
   Material became stiffer and stronger after treatment with glutaraldehyde solution as well as more resistant to proteolytic degradation then non-treated one.
   These biomechanical differences could be explained by formation of collagen crosslink after glutaraldehyde treatment. We conclude that treating with glutaraldehyde improve the application of autologous human pericardium as the plastic material for surgical repair of congenital heart anomalies by improving its biomechanical properties and increasing resistance to proteolytic degradation.

AB The surface modification of a sintered titanium scaffold could play an important role in bone tissue engineering. In this study we have followed a biomimetic strategy where electromagnetically stimulated human SAOS-2 osteoblasts proliferated and built their extracellular matrix on a sintered titanium grid. In comparison with control conditions (standard cell culture incubator, where no electromagnetic stimulus was detectable), the electromagnetic stimulus (magnetic field, 2 mT; frequency, 75 Hz) increased the cell proliferation and the surface coating with decorin, osteopontin, and type-I collagen. The electromagnetic stimulus aimed at obtaining a better surface coating of the sintered titanium grid in terms of cell colonization and bone matrix. The superficially modified biomaterial could be used, in clinical applications, as an implant for bone repair.

AB As a biomaterial processing technology, the macro-porous resin purification has been used in biomaterial extraction for a few years. Acoustic cavitation could bring up huge energy in micro-space and be used to extract medicine materials from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). In the paper, how to improve and combine ultrasonic technique with macro-porous resin purification for medicine extraction are discussed. Firstly, the characteristics of ultrasound propagation in the mixture of biomaterials and liquor are researched for TCM extraction. Secondly, for overcoming some shortages of existing resin purification cylinder used for biomaterial extraction, a new design method assisted with ultrasound is introduced. Then, a new manufacture set of ultrasonic cylinder and adsorbing cylinder with porous resin has been integrated and applied in Chinese traditional medicine production. It was examined via practice that there are many advantages with the design: (1) In all over the cylinder, the ultrasound intensity is strong and symmetrical; (2) The cavitation yield is stronger relative to what in existing ultrasonic processors and automatic circum-rotation is realized in the ultrasonic cylinder; (3) The adsorbing efficiency is greatly improved with the new adsorbing cylinders of porous resin for medicine material adsorption and purification from complex prescription of TCM.

AB Ultrasound could be used to extract medicine materials from traditional Chinese herbs. And the macro-porous resin purification is an obvious biomaterial technology. The characteristics of ultrasound propagation in the mixture of biomaterials and liquor are researched for Chinese medicine extraction. And how to combine ultrasonic technique with macro-porous resin purification is discussed in the paper. To overcome some shortages of existing ultrasonic processors used for biomaterial extraction, a new structure and design method so-called self-circumrotation are introduced. A new machine system of multi-frequency and self-circumrotated ultrasonic cylinder, combined with the adsorbing cylinder of porous resin, has been integrated and applied in Chinese traditional medicine manufacture. It was examined via practice that there are three advantages with the design: (A) The ultrasound intensity is strong and symmetrical in all over the cylinder; and the cavitation yield is 1.3-2.8 times relative to what of ordinary processors; (B) The medium circumrotation is automatically realized in the cylinder; (C) The static and active adsorbing cylinders of porous resin are more effective for medicine material adsorption and purification from complex prescription of traditional Chinese medicine.

AB The field of tissue engineering requires improved methods to monitor tissue growth and function as well as the degradation of biomaterial scaffolds following implantation. Invasive methods of monitoring, such as histology or direct mechanical measurements, are less than ideal. Non-invasive imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-ray computed tomography (CT) or conventional ultrasound (US) might only provide morphological information. However, US Elasticity Imaging (UEI) can provide mechanical property information, in the form of elastic modulus images, as well as morphological information. 3D UEI will provide the spatial distribution in 3D of the mechanical property information. This information can be used to characterize and monitor the internal structure and composition of the tissue and scaffold. In order to determine the feasibility of using quantitative 3D UEI to monitor tissue scaffolds, experiments were designed to image Poly (1, 8 Octanediol-co-Citrate) (POC) scaffolds before and following chemically induced weight degradation. In the absence of tissue in growth, the amount degradation is directly related to the scaffold's elastic modulus. For each degradation state, the scaffolds were imbedded in gelatin and imaged with a 3D US scanning system while undergoing a quasi-static compression. A novel US image registration algorithm was used to estimate the displacement field and an elastic modulus reconstruction algorithm was then applied to the estimated displacements. The reconstructed elastic modulus images compared well with direct mechanical measurements and the amount of degradation.

AB A crucial factor in the tissue engineering of vascular is an effective cell seeding with uniform cell distribution on tubular scaffolds to eventually form functional tissue constructs in vitro. In the present study, we investigate the influence of initial seeding density on the morphological characteristics of porcine iliac artery endothelial cells (PIECs). The morrphological characteristics of cells was observed in the 6th, 10th, 12th generations, with three initial seeding densities :2500/well, 5000/well and 10000/well. The result reveals that different generations have different morrphological characteristics: tubule-like structures is not observed in the 6(th) generation while observed in 10(th) and 12(th) generations; PIECs formed tubule-like structures in the 12(th) generation at the first place then moved to the centre of the ring before confluence. Our data suggests that cells with a higher density tend to form a a uniform single layer, while a lower density to form a ununiform layer This work may offer a new way to select proper factors in the study of cellular compatibility on biomaterial for tissue-engineered vascular.

TI Surface polyethylene glycol enhances substrate-mediated gene delivery by
   nonspecifically immobilized complexes
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB Substrate-mediated gene delivery describes the immobilization of gene therapy vectors to a biomaterial, which enhances gene transfer by exposing adhered cells to elevated DNA concentrations within the local microenvironment. Surface chemistry has been shown to affect transfection by nonspecifically immobilized complexes using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols on gold. In this report, SAMs were again used to provide a controlled surface to investigate whether the presence of oligo(ethylene glycol) (EG) groups in a SAM could affect complex morphology and enhance transfection. EG groups were included at percentages that did not affect cell adhesion. Nonspecific complex immobilization to SAMs containing combinations of EG- and carboxylic acid-terminated alkanethiols resulted in substantially greater transfection than surfaces containing no EG groups or SAMs composed of EG groups combined with other functional groups. Enhancement in transfection levels could not be attributed to complex binding densities or release profiles. Atomic force microscopy imaging of immobilized complexes revealed that EG groups within SAMs affected complex size and appearance and could indicate the ability of these surfaces to preserve complex morphology upon binding. The ability to control the morphology of the immobilized complexes and influence transfection levels through surface chemistry could be translated to scaffolds for gene delivery in tissue engineering and diagnostic applications.

AB Optical properties of different type of surface treatments of titanium biomaterial as polishing, grinding, and chemical etching are investigated in details. The main aim of this study is in sensing the organisation of nano-scale fibrinogen and oligonugleotides adhered on biomaterial surface. Thus permittivity change and the fluctuation in optical roughness of treated titanium surface, when titanium surface is subjected to the contamination of buffer fractions as well as to the contamination of human plasma fibrinogen fraction, are investigated through optical window of a cuvette by using diffiractive optical element based sensor, During the progress of this work also optical ellipsometry as a corroborative method was used to verify the attachment of the molecules on the biomaterial surface.

AB Bioactive glasses are materials that have been used for the repair and reconstruction of diseased bone tissues. as they exhibit direct bonding with human bone tissues. However, bioactive lasses have low mechanical properties compared to cortical and cancellous bone. On the other hand, composite materials of biodegradable polymers with inorganic bioactive glasses are of particular interest to engineered scaffolds because they often show an excellent balance between strength and toughness and usually improved characteristics compared to their individual components. Composite bioactive glass-polyvinyl alcohol foams for use as scaffolds in tissue engineering were previously developed using the sol-gel route. The goal of this work was the synthesis of composite foams modified with higher amounts of . Samples were characterized by morphological and chemical analysis. The mechanical behavior of the obtained materials was also investigated. The degree of hydrolysis of PVA. concentration of PVA solution and different PVA-bioactive glass composition ratios affect the synthesis procedure. Foams with up to 80 wt% polymer content were obtained. The hybrid scaffolds obtained exhibited macroporous structure with pore sire varying Prom 50 to 600 fan and improved mechanical properties.

Ti-13Nb-13Zr is a titanium alloy specifically developed for surgical implants. In this work, highly porous titanium foams, with porosities above from 50%, are reached using an efficient powder metallurgical process, which includes the introduction of a selected spacer into the starting powders. Samples were produced by mixing of initial metallic powders followed by uniaxial and cold isostatic pressing with subsequent densification by sintering. The samples presented a Widmanstatten-like microstructure in an open cellular morphology with pore size between 200-500 mu m.

AB Porosity and pore size are critical features for biomaterial scaffolds as they play an essential role in bone formation and bone ingrowth in vivo. Therefore, techniques for scaffolds evaluation are of great importance for their design and processing. Porous titanium has been used for grafts and implant coatings as it allows the mechanical interlocking of the pores and bone. In this study, porous titanium samples were manufactured by powder metallurgy. The porosity quantification was assessed by optical quantitative metallographic analysis, and non-destructive gamma-ray transmission and X-ray microtomography techniques, in order to compare their efficacy for porosity evaluation. Pore morphology and surface topography were characterized via scanning electron microscopy. These techniques have demonstrated to be suitable for titanium scaffolds evaluation, and micro-CT was the one that allowed the three-dimensional porosity assessment.

AB In order to improve implant-bone attachment, porous titanium has been used to achieve the ingrowth of bone tissue within the porous structure. Although this biomaterial has shown efficient bone adhesion for orthopedic and dental implants, the ideal surface must have chemical bonds at the implant-bone interface. In this work, samples of pure porous titanium were produced by powder metallurgy technique and submitted to biomimetic process in order to evaluate the material's bioactivity and to enhance its osteoconductivity. The samples were immersed in modified simulated body fluid (mSBF) which induces the nucleation and growth of a calcium phosphate bioactive film and a chemical bond with titanium. SEM, EDX and FTIR analyses showed that a calcium phosphate deposition occurred without the need of pre-treatments to increase the surface bioactivity. As a result, this research revealed the potential for obtaining a bonelike apatite film on this porous titanium by biomimetic method.

AB Despite of the wide use of hydroxyapatite (HA) for bone repair and regeneration, its brittleness has limited clinical application to less stressed body parts. Thus, evaluation of HA mechanical properties has been an important research matter. The aim of this study is to assess the compressive strength of a stoichiometric HA with 1.66 Ca/P molar ratio, synthesized by hydrothermal method. Cylindrical samples were processed by uniaxial compacting, followed by sintering. Compressive strength of cylindrical samples with 2.0 medium diameter/height ratio was measured according to ASTM C 1424. Load to failure divided by the cross-sectional area of the samples were reported and microstructural characterization was made by MEV-EDS. The compression strength results were compared to values reported in the literature.

AB Titanium has widely been used as a biomaterial because of its excellent corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. However, problems with respect to biological reaction and fitness of elastic modulus for human bone or tooth have yet to be solved. Porous titanium is expected to be a promising material to solve these problems. The aim of this study is to clarify the effect of the porous structure of this material on the biomechanical compatibility. The spherical pure titanium powder, with an average particle size of 100 mu m, was sintered by spark plasma sintering. The sintered porous titanium compacts had a porosity of 33%. The specimens were machined from the sintered compacts for the evaluation of the mechanical properties. The elastic modulus indicated a value close to human bone, while the tensile and compressive strengths showed lower values than those of human bone.

TI In vitro and in vivo comparison of five biomaterials used for orthopedic
   soft tissue augmentation
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB Objective - To compare biomaterials used in orthopedics with respect to in vitro cell viability and cell retention and to in vivo tissue healing and regeneration.
   Animals - 65 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats and synovium, tendon, meniscus, and bone marrow specimens obtained from 4 adult canine cadavers.
   Procedures - Synovium, tendon, meniscus, and bone marrow specimens were used to obtain synovial fibroblasts, tendon fibroblasts, meniscal fibrochondrocytes, and bone marrow-derived connective tissue progenitor cells for culture on 5 biomaterials as follows: cross-linked porcine small intestine (CLPSI), non-cross-linked human dermis, cross-linked porcine dermis, non-cross-linked porcine small intestine (NCLPSI), and non-cross-linked fetal bovine dermis. After 1 week of culture, samples were evaluated for cell viability, cell density, and extracellular matrix production. Biomaterials were evaluated in a 1-cm(2) abdominal wall defect in rats. Each biomaterial was subjectively evaluated for handling, suturing, defect fit, and ease of creating the implant at the time of surgery, then grossly and histologically 6 and 12 weeks after surgery.
   Results - All biomaterials allowed for retention of viable cells in culture; however, CLPSI and NCLPSI were consistently superior in terms of cell viability and cell retention. Cell infiltration for NCLPSI was superior to other biomaterials. The NCLPSI appeared to be replaced with regenerative tissue most rapidly in vivo and scored highest in all subjective evaluations of ease of use.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - These data suggested that NCLPSI and CLPSI have favorable properties for further investigation of clinical application in orthopedic tissue engineering.

The chemical and mechanical extracellular environments are critical regulators of these processes, affecting integrin-matrix binding, cell adhesion strength, and cell migration. Understanding the synergy between matrix chemistry and mechanics will ultimately lead to precise control over adhesion and migration. Moreover, a better understanding of endothelial cell adhesion is critical for development of therapeutics and biomaterials for the treatment of endothelial cell dysfunction and the progression of vascular disease. This chapter will focus on the specific interactions between endothelial cells and the extracellular matrix that mediate adhesion and migration. Several engineering methods used to probe and quantify encdothelial cell adhesion and migration will be discussed.

AB Several absorbable nerve conduits are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Conformit Europe (CE) for clinical repair of peripheral and cranial nerves. Surgeons are often not aware of the different (bio)materials of these conduits when performing nerve repair. An overview of these FDA- and CE-approved absorbable nerve conduits for clinical use is presented. PubMed. MEDLINE, and the companies selling the conduits were consulted. The available FDA and CE absorbable nerve conduits for peripheral and cranial nerve repair are 2 collagen- and 2 synthetic-polyester-based conduits. The available clinical data, the price, the length, and the composition of the tube show significant differences. Based on the available data in this paper at this moment, we favor the PGA (Neurotube) nerve conduit for repair of peripheral and cranial nerve defects because of its advantages in length, price, and availability of clinical data. However, no prospective studies comparing the available nerve conduits have been published.

AB Three-dimensional porous scaffolds play a critical role in both cell targeting and cell transplantation strategies. Small intestine submucosa (SIS) has been recommended as a cell-free, biocompatible and with minimum immune response biomaterial. However, the three-dimensional structure of SIS isn't very suit for tissue regeneration and tissue engineering. So, we tried to prepare SIS sponges and got a kind of novel scaffold. Scanning electron microscope showed that SIS sponge had interconnected network structure and comparably regular pore. The pore diameter was around 100-150 mu m. In vivo implantation test, the sponges were implanted in dorsal muscle of rats for 4 weeks and the results suggest that the SIS sponges had good biocompatibility and also could completely degrade in vivo. So we conclude that the SIS sponges maybe are available scaffolds for injury repair.

SO BIO-MEDICAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The key joint of the forefoot during gait is the first metatarsophalangeal joint. It plays an important role in propelling the human form but can be subject to a number of diseases which can lead to its replacement with an artificial joint. Some of these designs of prosthesis employ a two-piece ball and socket arrangement and are available with a range of biomaterial couples including ceramic-on-ceramic, metal-on-metal and metal-on-polymer. Calculation of predicted lubrication regimes applicable to these implant designs was undertaken. Modelling the ball and socket implant as an equivalent ball-on-plane model and employing elastohydrodynamic theory allowed the minimum film thickness to be calculated and in turn the lambda ratio to indicate the lubrication regime. The calculations were undertaken for a 50 to 1500 N range of loading values, a 0 to 30 mm/s range of entraining velocities, and a 3 to 15 mm radius range of sizes. Calculations showed that the ceramic-on-ceramic and metal-on-metal implants could operate under fluid film lubrication, whereas the metal-on-polymer combination operated in the boundary lubrication regime. It was also recognized that manufacturing capabilities are critical to the radial clearances and values of surface roughness that can be achieved, and thus the predicted lubrication regime.

TI Polyelectrolyte multilayer films: Effect of the initial anchoring layer
   on the cell growth
SO BIO-MEDICAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB In tissue engineering, surface characteristics of a biomaterial are one of most important factors determining the compatibility with the environment. They influence attachment and growth of cells onto the material. In many cases, the surface should to be modified and engineered in the desired direction. The modification of non-adhesive surfaces with polyelectrolyte multilayer films (PMF) was recently depicted as a powerful technique to promote the growth of different cell lines. In this study, we evaluated the possible use of two different PMF as surface modification for the culture of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). We used two types of PMF which differed by the nature of the initial anchoring layer which was poly( ethylenimine) (PEI) or poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH). This initial polyelectrolytes adsorption was followed by the alternated deposition of poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and (PAH) in order to obtain a PEI-(PSS-PAH)(3) film or a PAH-(PSS-PAH)(3) film. In order to control the behaviour of MSC, the cell viability was evaluated by Alamar Blue assay and the actin cytoskeleton was labelled and visualised in a confocal microscope. The behaviour of cells on the two PMF was compared to cells cultivated on surfaces treated with fibronectin. The results showed that PAH-(PSS-PAH)(3) PMF improve the growth of cells, inducing a higher cell viability compared to PEI-(PSS-PAH)(3) PMF and fibronectin at 2, 3 and 7 days of culture. Moreover, those cells showed a well-organized actin cytoskeleton. In conclusion, PAH-(PSS-PAH)(3) polyelectrolyte multilayer film seems to constitute an excellent material for MSC seeding.

TI Three-dimensional sprayed active biological gels and cells for tissue
   engineering application
SO BIO-MEDICAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Complex three-dimensional structures can "a priori" be built layer-by-layer with a large number of different components, including various cell types, polyelectrolytes, drugs, proteins, peptides or DNA. Our approach is based on the spraying of such elements in order to form a highly functionalized and structured biomaterial. The proposed route will allow the control at the surface and in depth the distribution of the different included elements (matrix and cells).
   The main objective of this work concerns the buildup of biomaterials aimed to reconstruct biological tissue. The proposed ways are highly innovative and consist in a simple and progressive spraying of all the elements constituting finally the biomaterial.
   We report here that it is possible (i) to build an alginate gel by alternate spraying of alginate and Ca(2+); (ii) to spray active alginate gel and cells; (iii) to build layer-by-layer an active reservoir under and on the top of this sprayed gel and cells; (iv) to follow the activity of these sprayed cells with time; ( v) to propose a three-dimensional sprayed structure for tissue engineering application.

AB A porous silicon-containing hydroxyapatite has been prepared using natural coral as a calcium source to obtain a biomaterial having an improved biocompatibility. From the XRD analysis, it was confirmed that the single-phase hydroxyapatite containing silicon has formed without revealing the presence of extra phases related to silicon dioxide or other calcium phosphate species. Silicon content is ranged from 0.5wt% to 1wt% by weight. The porous silicon-containing hydroxyapatite blocks were inserted into the 5mm diameter of drill holes made through the lateral femoral condyles of New Zealand white rabbits. The new bony formation did not begin after I week. At 3 week, bony ongrowth to the inserted porous silicon-containing hydroxyapatite block could be found, and the new bone surrounded the inserted block entirely after 24weeks. Based on in-vivo test, Si-containing porous hydroxyapatite derived from coral possesses high biodegradability and can be considered a useful material for bone implants.

AB In order to modify the biological properties of pure hydroxyapatite (HAp), two kinds of zinc-containing HAp, which had zinc content of 5.10wt% and 2.54wt%, respectively, were synthesized via sol-gel technique. The obtained coatings were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SENT). Then the antibacterial effects were evaluated through bacteriostatic test on Streptococcus mutans (S.mutans) in vitro and zinc ions releasing ability was investigated through detecting the zinc ions concentration by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The obtained coatings were observed to possess typical apatite peaks in XRD patterns and high homogeneous and porous surfaces in SENT morphology. The coating layer demonstrated good releasing ability in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) liquid and obviously inhibitory effects to the growth and proliferation of S. mutans. Based on the results obtained above, it is concluded that the sol-gel derived zinc-containing hydroxyapatite could be applied as an antibacterial effective biomaterial.

AB A edible cuttlefish(Zoological name : Sepia esculenta) bone has a porous structure with all pores interconnected The purpose of this research is to develop porous hydroxyapatite prepared by hydrothermal treatment from cuttlefish bone and evaluate the biocompatibility using undecalcified materials through the in-vivo test of rabbits. In this study, the phase and substructure of a porous hydroxyapatite, prepared by hydrothermal treatment using edible cuttlefish bone as a calcium source, has been confirmed by X-ray diffractometer and scanning electronic microscope. After preparing the specimens with 5mm diameter and 7mm length, the specimens were implanted into the femoral condyles of rabbits. Each rabbits were sacrificed at each time period of 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks after operation, respectively and the stained section was examined by a transmission light microscope. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the edible cuttlefish bone was confirm for aragonite phase and of the sample after hydrothermal treatment showed mostly into hydroxyapatite phase. There was more bone density increase in porous HA rod around implant site than natural edible cuttlefish bone. Because the edible cuttlefish bone is a very pure and good calcium source, porous hydroxyapatite developed from this study is expected to be a biomaterial having a good biocompatibility to be used as a suitable bone substitute.

AB The first generation of synthetic bone substitute materials (BSM) was initially investigated in the mid 1970s using hydroxyapatite (HA) as a biomaterial for remodeling of bone defects. The concepts established by CPC pioneers in the early 1980s were used as a platform to initiate a second generation of BSM for commercialization. Since then, advances have been made in composition, performance and manufacturing.
   A self-setting and injectable calcium phosphate cement (CPC) based on amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) with calcium to phosphate (Ca/P) atomic ratio less than 1.5, combined with dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD or brushite.. seeded with apatite), is proposed. Amorphization of raw material was observed following high energy mechano-chemical processing. Upon hydration, the cement hardened in less than 3 minutes at 37 degrees C and reached a maximum compressive strength of about 50 MPa.
   The final product was a low crystalline calcium deficient carbonated apatite similar to the composition and structure of bone mineral.
   In vivo performance of this cement in mediating bone healing was compared to alpha-BSM (R) in a rabbit femoral defect model.
   Performance characteristics of some commercially available CPC products are compared. The concerns of CPC designers and the needs of product users (surgeons) are discussed.

It was developed to minimize invasive surgery in various applications in orthopedic and dental surgery. The IBS considered of a polymer solution mixed with biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) ceramic particles. Two particle sizes of BCP (40-80 and 80-200 mu m) were used and the weight ratio was 40%. This study investigated the influence of polymer solution on the OF BCP particles stability. Effects of particles size and limiting viscosity of polymer on the sedimentation were studied. The polymer concentration and particles size can be adapted to provide the best stability and storage of IBS.

AB Bioactive ceramics such as hydroxypatite (HA) promote and enhance biological fixation. There is still a discussion oil the desired longevity of the coating. Stable coatings require an optimum between resorption rate, flexural strength and adhesive strength of the coating. Ceramic coatings containing fluorapatite (FA, Ca5(PO4)(3)F) and calcium zirconium phosphate (CZP, CaZr4(PO4)(6)) promise lower resorption rates than conventional HA coatings in the biological milieu. It is hoped that they can improve the long-term stability of implants by eliminating the detrimental resorption of coating material. For the in vivo studies plasma sprayed coatings were generated. The materials were implanted into the distal femur epiphysis of rabbits and investigated after 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 weeks postoperatively. Histological analysis was preformed on the areas surrounding the implant. The amount of osseointegration was determined by using the automatically image analysis. The bonding strengths were compared with HA coating and uncoated titanium alloy. According to available data, there is inhibition of mineralization of bone at the interface of calcium zirconium phosphate ceramics of the described composition.

AB Carbon nanotubes could avoid the crack propagation and enhance the toughness of the ceramic material used for prostheses applications. So nanozirconia partially coated carbon nanotubes have been obtained via hydrothermal synthesis of zirconia nanoparticles in presence of multiwall carbon nanotubes. The as covered nanotubes should have a better wettability in the ceramic matrix and improve the dispersion of the CNTs in the nanocomposite, which results in a new ceramic biomaterial with a longer lifetime and better reliability. The obtained product has been structurally characterized by several techniques such as FTIR, XRD, SEM, AFM, EELS, XPS and TGA. The citotoxicity of the sintered product was studied by the change in the pH and ICP-AES in in-vitro biocompatibility tests.

In terms of bone tissue growth, this ceramic can be more attractive presenting a porous microstructure. To obtain biomaterial quality ceramics, in this investigation beta- TCP porous ceramics were prepared by a special consolidation method with albumin as a foam generating agent. This technique enables preparation a variety of formats with complex geometries. To obtain porous samples using albumin, heat had to be introduced into the system during the consolidation stage. After consolidation, the samples were sintered at 1250 degrees C for 30 minutes and characterized using X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy and mercury porosimetry. The foams that were obtained by this method exhibited spherical and interconnected pores, characteristics desirable in biomedical implants.

AB The nacre layer from the pearl oyster shell is considered as a promising osteoinductive biomaterial. Nacre contains one or more signal molecules capable of stimulating bone formation. The identity and the mode of action of these molecules on the osteoblast differentiation were analyzed. Water-soluble molecules from nacre were fractionated according to dialysis, solvent extraction and reversed-phase HPLC. The activity of a fraction composed of low molecular weight molecules in the mineralization of the MC3T3-E1 extracellular matrix was investigated. Mineralization of the preosteoblast cells was monitored according to alizarin red staining, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and quantitative RT-PCR. Molecules isolated from nacre, ranging from 50 to 235 Da, induced a red alizarin staining of the preosteoblasts extracellular matrix after 16 days of culture. Raman spectroscopy demonstrated the presence of hydroxyapatite in samples treated with these molecules. Scanning electron microscopy pictures showed at the surface of the treated cells the occurence of clusters of spherical particles ressembling to hydroxyapatite. The treatment of cells with nacre molecules accelerated expression of collagen I and increased the mRNA expression of Runx2 and osteopontin. This study indicated that the nacre molecules efficient in bone cell differentiation are certainly different from proteins, and could be useful for in vivo bone repair.

AB Because of its high biocompatibility, hydroxyapatite(HA) has been considered as a good blasting material. DNA microarray is a new molecular technology that enables the analysis of gene expression in parallel on a very large number of genes, spanning a significant fraction of the human genome. It is a qualitive analysis (e,g. it can differentiate each single gene) and quantitative, since it has the sensitivity to detect a change of expression level in the investigated cells when compared to normal samples. The aim of this study is to define the cell attachment and the genetic effect of machined surface implant and RBM (resorbable blast media) surface implant on the osteoblastic cell (MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cell line) by cDNA microarray slide containing 21575 genes. Cells were Cultured on machined grade 4 titanium disks(Group 1, machined surface) and disks of RBM (Group 2) and the samples were moved to new dishes and media were added and the plated disks were cultured for 24 hours. Total RNA extraction was performed with Qiagen mini kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA, USA) for microarray assay. Microarray assay after culturing the cells on the machined surface and RBM surface revealed that osteoinductive molecules appeared more prominent on the RBM surface, whereas the adhesion molecules on the biomaterial were higher on the machined surface than RBM surface.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytocompatibility, cell ingrowth and extracellular matrix deposition of a newly developed porous bioactive glass as a bone substitute. Two types of bioactive glass, different in their pore size (75 and 20 ppi, resp. similar to 350 and similar to 1200 mu m), were used in this study. The materials were seeded with human osteoblastic (MG63) and fibroblastic (M-228 F01 and M-191 F01) cell lines. The cells were visualized by two techniques, scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. For confocal microscopy cell nuclei were labeled with propidium iodide (IP) and the extracellular matrix components (type I collagen and osteocalcin) by specific antibodies. Cells and matrix were visualized by fluorescence. The bioactive glass used in this study was shown to be non cytotoxic. Cell growth and colonization at the surface and in the depth of the material were observed. Extracellular matrix deposition was also demonstrated which proved the proper biofunctionality of the biomaterial. Scanning electron microscope allowed us to visualize cells at a high magnification at the surface of the bioglass and evidenced that the biomaterials were covered by a sheet of cells with their matrix; on the other hand, confocal microscopy permitted us to observe cell ingrowth and matrix deposition within the depth of the substitute. We showed that extracellular matrix was synthesized mainly in the upper levels where the cell population was the most confluent. In summary, this porous bioglass appears promising for bone substitution.

AB Magnetite nanoparticles were used for their ability to be heated when they are put in an oscillating magnetic field. When they are located inside tumors they can eradicate the tumor cells by heating. We have developed a biomaterial constituted by a mineral degradable matrix containing magnetite nanoparticles. This material can be injected into bone metastasis in which it sets and releases magnetite particles uptaked inside the cancer cells. We have implanted this material inside rabbit bone to check by histology the fate of the nanoparticles in bone. The implant matrix was degraded within a few days releasing the nanoparticles. They were found inside monocytes and fibroblasts having ingrown the material. The nanoparticles could form aggregates which then were fragmented in micro/nanoparticles penetrating the surrounding cells. This study showed that the nanoparticles are released from the mineral matrix within a few days and penetrate the cells in their close proximity.

AB Dedicated to Minimal Invasive Surgery MIS particularly in spine for vertebroplasty, the surgeons and radiologists ask for improvement of radio opacity, to be sure of the injection site, and to prevent injection in blood vessels. MBCP Gel(R) is an Injectible biomaterial non self hardening, the biomaterials consists of BCP granules associated with a hydrosoluble polymer. These materials have been shown to be perfectly biocompatible and potentially resorbable and, thanks to their initial plasticity, they assume the shape of the bone defects very easily, eliminating the need to shape the material to adjust to the implantation site. MBCP gels do not have mechanical properties like the hydraulic bone cements. However bone cells are able to invade the spaces created by the disappearance of the polymer carrier. Bone ingrowth takes place all around the granules at the expense of the resorption of the BCP granules. In time, the mechanical property is increased due to the presence of the newly formed bone. This study demonstrates an improvement of MBCP get by freeze drying and reconstitution using iodine solution or sterile water in a classical model of rabbit bone defects.

The present exploratory study aim was to study the safety of MBCP-gel, and to determine in the osseous healthy area the performance of MBCP gel. We expected to prove bone ingrowth into the osseous cavities created during drilling biopsy of the aseptic osteonecrosis of femoral head.

AB The association of TricOs (TM) (Macroporous Biphasic Ceramic Phosphate MBCP granules) and the fibrin sealant FS VH S/D 4, has been developed to answer a challenging request of orthopaedic surgeons: a biocompatible, osteogenic, mouldable, and self-hardening bone substitute able to fill randomly shaped bone defects. The aims of this study was the evaluation of the performance and safety of the bioactive bone substitute TricOS (TM) associated with a fibrin sealant in regeneration of functional bone. The pre-clinical tests were conducted to optimize MBCP granules size and ratio MBCP-FS VH S/D 4 (sheep maxillary sinus grafting, femoral epiphysis defect in rabbits, long bone defects in sheep). A clinical study design was set up as an exploratory prospective French multicentric phase II study sponsored by INSERM (Institut National de la Saute et de la Recherche Medicale). The application was the TOV (Tibial Osteotomy of Valgisation) using osteosynthesis and bone substitute: TricOs (TM) mixed with the fibrin sealant (FS VH S/D 4) for filling the space created. The follow up is 13 months with safety checks, clinical assessments, high-sensitivity X-ray, and CT-scan imaging. A bone sample will be collected from the reconstructed area at 12 months, during the osteosynthesis material removal surgery. The principal criterion is CT-scan imaging performed 12 months after TOV surgery, before material removal, to assess qualitative and quantitative bone reconstruction. Animals' studies demonstrate that the biomaterial is safe to use and shows osteoconductive properties, granules resorption and bone ingrowth at the expenses of the implants. As for clinical trial, 7 patients are today included in the study: This paper present the first results obtained from X-ray imaging during follow up.

AB Successful craniofacial reconstruction needs both a well-known and a reliable reconstruction material. However, there is often a lack of long-term knowledge of the tissue reactions and healing process in the human body. In this study, frontal sinus obliterations with bovine bone natural hydroxyapatite derivative (BHA), synthetic bioactive glass S53P4 (BAG) and hydroxyapatite cement (HAC) were investigated with clinical, histologic, scanning electron microscopic (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDXA) 27, 12 and 3 years postoperatively. The aim was to determine the long-term clinical biocompatibility of the used materials. Histologic studies revealed bone formation with BHA particles and lamellar bone with BAG granule remnants in close contact to the new bone formation. In HAC reconstruction there was scattered fibroconnective tissue growth without new bone formation in the surface of HAC implantation. Neither foreign body reaction nor any abnormal findings were seen. SEM studies revealed a CaP layer on the surface of BAG granule remnants. In EDXA studies, composition profiles showed Ca-, P- and Si- rich layers on the BAG granule surface. No differences were found in CaO and P2O5 levels between BHA granules and HAC implantation and the surrounding bone. All investigated biomaterials were well tolerated in long-term applications.

AB A new device called biomechanical stimulation device (BSD) has been recently developped and is under patenting process. This BSD allows to apply shocks to a biomaterial disc, on which bone cells have been seeded. To observe the real behaviour of the biomaterial under shock loading, the BSD is instrumented with an impact hammer and an accelerometer. Force and acceleration signals are recorded, and signal analysis can be performed, in particular Fourier analysis. The results obtained lead to a better understanding of the stimulus that the cells can perceive at the top surface of the biomaterial disc. It appears that mechanical shocks applied at 1 Hps (Hit per second) or 10 Hps generate a frequency content up to 35 kHz. The main further objective will be to characterize the influence of mechanical shocks on bone cells proliferation.

TI Morphology of artificial silica matrices formed via autosilification of
   a silaffin/protein polymer chimera
SO BIOMACROMOLECULES
AB Protein polymers (long-chain proteins in which a specific amino acid sequence "monomer" is repeated through the molecule) are found widely in nature, and these materials exhibit a diverse array of physical properties. One class of self-as.sembling proteins is hydrophobic-polar (HP) protein polymers capable of self-assembly under the appropriate solution conditions. We generated a chimeric protein consisting of an HP protein polymer monomer unit, EAK(1) (sequence n-AEAEAKAKAEAEAKAK-c), and a silaffin peptide, R5 (sequence: n-SSKKSGSYSG-SKGSKRRIL-c). First identified in diatoms, silaffins represent a class of proteins and peptides capable of directing silica precipitation in vitro at neutral pH and ambient temperatures. The EAK(1)-R5 chimera demonstrated self-assembly into hydrogels and the ability to direct silica precipitation in vitro. This chimera is capable of generating silica morphologies and feature sizes significantly different from those achievable with the R5 peptide alone, indicating that fusions of silaffins with self-assembling proteins may be a route to controlling the morphology of artificially produced silica matrices.

TI Heparin intercalation into reconstituted collagen I fibrils: Impact on
   growth kinetics and morphology
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Collagen type I fibrils, reconstituted in vitro in the presence of heparin, exhibit an unusually thick and straight shape. A detailed structural analysis by scanning force and scanning electron microscopy revealed a non-linear dependence in size distribution, width-to-length ratio, and morphology over a wide range of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) concentrations. By varying molecular weight, degree of sulphation, charge, and concentration of different GAGs we are able to correlate the morphological data with kinetic turbidimetric measurements, and quantitation of fibril-bound GAG. The experiments imply a pronounced impact of the prenucleation phase on the cofibril morphology as a result of the strong electrostatic interaction of heparin with tropocollagen. Heparin is assumed to stabilize the collagen microfibrils and to enhance their parallel accretion during cofibrillogenesis with preservation of the typical asymmetric collagen banding pattern. The heparin quantitation data show heparin to be intercalated as a linker molecule with one specific binding site inside the cofibrils. The reconstituted cofibrils with their unusual morphology and GAG intercalation-a phenomenon not reported in vivo-can be expected to exhibit interesting mechanical and biochemical behaviours as a biomaterial for extracellular matrix scaffolds.

TI The use of keratin biomaterials derived from human hair for the
   promotion of rapid regeneration of peripheral nerves
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The management of trauma-associated nerve defects is difficult because of the absence of autologous donor motor or sensory nerves. Pre-clinical development and clinical experience has shown that damaged nerves can be surgically repaired using a tubular conduit interposed across the defect. Acceptable patient outcomes are achieved so long as the gap distance does not exceed a few centimeters. Although research in animals has demonstrated that nerve repair can be facilitated across slightly larger gaps by introducing a biomaterial filler into the conduit lumen, these biomaterials are not typically "neuroinductive" (i.e. capable of acting directly on regenerative cells to enhance nerve tissue formation beyond clinical limits). Moreover, their use does not often result in functional recovery equivalent to nerve autograft, the clinical gold standard. Here we show that a biomaterial gel made from the proteins found in human hair can mediate a robust nerve regeneration response, in part through activation of Schwann cells. In vitro, keratins extracted from human hair enhance the activity of Schwann cells by a chemotactic mechanism, increase their attachment and proliferation, and upregulate expression of important genes. Moreover, these characteristics translate to improved functional nerve recovery in an animal model. These results suggest that a biomaterial derived from human hair keratins is neuroinductive and can facilitate an outcome comparable to autograft in a nerve injury model. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Assessment of stem cell/biomaterial combinations for stem cell-based
   tissue engineering
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Biomaterials are used in tissue engineering with the aim to repair or reconstruct tissues and organs. Frequently, the identification and development of biomaterials is an iterative process with biomaterials being designed and then individually tested for their properties in combination with one specific cell type. However, recent efforts have been devoted to systematic, combinatorial and parallel approaches to identify biomaterials, suitable for specific applications. Embryonic and adult stem cells represent an ideal cell source for tissue engineering. Since stem cells can be readily isolated, expanded and transplanted, their application in cell-based therapies has become a major focus of research. Biomaterials can potentially influence e.g. stem cell proliferation and differentiation in both, positive or negative ways and biomaterial characteristics have been applied to repel or attract stem cells in a niche-like microenvironment. Our consortium has now established a grid-based platform to investigate stem cell/biomaterial interactions. So far, we have assessed 140 combinations of seven different stem cell types and 19 different polymers performing systematic screening assays to analyse parameters such as morphology, vitality, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and proliferation. We thus can suggest and advise for and against special combinations for stem cell-based tissue engineering. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The biomaterial influences the ossification after sinus floor elevation
   using tissue-engineered bone grafts
SO BIOMEDIZINISCHE TECHNIK
AB Sinus floor elevation is the standard procedure that allows dental implant insertion in the atrophic posterior maxilla. Instead of autogenous bone, tissue-engineered bone grafts can be used, but clear comparative clinical studies also assessing the influence of the biomaterial are missing. In six patients, tissue-engineered bone grafts were used in eight sinus floor elevations. After culturing osteoblast-like cells from biopsies of the maxilla, they were seeded on scaffolds made either from demineralised bovine bone matrix (DBBM) or from solvent-dehydrated mineralised bovine bone (SDBB), and grafted. In all patients primary wound healing was without complications, except for one patient in the SDBB group. After 12 months, implant insertion was possible only in the SDBB group; in the DBBM group, fibrous connective tissue was found in an attempt of implant insertion. After 5 months, implant placement was performed in one patient of each group. However, the two implants inserted in the DBBM group were lost after 6 weeks. Histology of the bone cores in the DBBM group at 5 months showed lamellar bone and osteoid, and at 12 months showed fibrous connective tissue. Inflammation and some resorption of the scaffold was found 5 months after SDBB grafting, and after 12 months cancellous bone formation encapsulating SDBB remnants were observed. These preliminary data suggest that the preparation method of the bovine bone matrix, in particular the mineral content, and therefore the mechanical stability may have some influence on the generation of new bone.

CY MAY, 2007
CL Athens, GREECE
AB Tissue engineering remains a promising therapeutic strategy for the repair or regeneration of diseased or damaged tissues. Previous approaches have typically focused on combining cells and bioactive molecules ( e. g., growth factors, cytokines and DNA fragments) with a biomaterial scaffold that functions as a template to control the geometry of the newly formed tissue, while facilitating the attachment, proliferation, and differentiation of embedded cells. Biomaterial scaffolds also play a crucial role in determining the functional properties of engineered tissues, including biomechanical characteristics such as inhomogeneity, anisotropy, nonlinearity or viscoelasticity. While single-phase, homogeneous materials have been used extensively to create numerous types of tissue constructs, there continue to be significant challenges in the development of scaffolds that can provide the functional properties of load-bearing tissues such as articular cartilage. In an attempt to create more complex scaffolds that promote the regeneration of functional engineered tissues, composite scaffolds comprising two or more distinct materials have been developed. This paper reviews various studies on the development and testing of composite scaffolds for the tissue engineering of articular cartilage, using techniques such as embedded fibers and textiles for reinforcement, embedded solid structures, multi-layered designs, or three-dimensionally woven composite materials. In many cases, the use of composite scaffolds can provide unique biomechanical and biological properties for the development of functional tissue engineering scaffolds.

TI Chitosan and its derivatives for tissue engineering applications
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVANCES
AB Tissue engineering is an important therapeutic strategy for present and future medicine. Recently, functional biomaterial researches have been directed towards the development of improved scaffolds for regenerative medicine. Chitosan is a natural polymer from renewable resources, obtained from shell of shellfish, and the wastes of the seafood industry. It has novel properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, antibacterial, and wound-healing activity. Furthermore, recent studies suggested that chitosan and its derivatives are promising candidates as a supporting material for tissue engineering applications owing to their porous structure, gel forming properties, ease of chemical modification, high affinity to in vivo macromolecules, and so on. In this review, we focus on the various types of chitosan derivatives and their use in various tissue engineering applications namely, skin, bone, cartilage, liver, nerve and blood vessel.

The morphology of NCS self-assembled vesicles was investigated by SEM. Drug-releasing rates of vesicles made from longer alkyl chain and/or larger backbone molecular weight of N,N-dialkyl chitosan are slower than shorter and smaller ones, and equilibrium drug-releasing ratios as well as releasing rates. The bio-experimental results indicate that NCS/PLLA blends are biodegradable and nontoxic. NCS is benefit to improve the cell affinity of PLLA.

AB The detection of organophosphoric insecticides, in a simple manner was made using impedimetric enzyme biosensors, which allow determination in sub-micromolar concentration ranges. This type of measurement applies for monitoring of biocatalytic reactions based on irreversible inhibition of the enzyme (acetylcholinesterase). The reaction involves generation of charged species, which leads to a global change in the ionic composition of the tested solution.
   Our work has been focused on the development of an impedimetric microsensor for direct detection of dichorvos, because this kind of biosensor presents a number of advantages such as: miniaturized electrodes based on gold thin film; easy production using standard microtechnology; low cost; no reference electrode required; no light sensitivity, and differential mode measurements possibile allowing elimination of interferences. In addition, dichlorvos is targeted to be detected considering that the commonest poisoning today is due to: Methyl Parathion (metacid), Dichorvos (Nuvan), Zinc Phosphide and Aluminium Phosphide (Celphos).
   The biosensor with interdigitated electrodes and immobilized acetylcholinesteraze (AChE) measures the impedance of the layer adjacent to the electrode surface. The impedimetric measurement consists of determining the conductivity and capacitance of the solution between two interdigitated electrodes. The chemistry of deposited enzymatic layer (concentration, enzymatic activity measuring, deposition protocol), the immobilization technique for AChE, the fabrication technique and the electrical characteristiques of the enzymatic sensor have been studied.
   AChE immobilization was performed by ionic adsorption on polyethylenglycol (PEG) bio-polymeric substrate, by including in the gel. The functionalized electrodes deposited with biomaterial were inserted into the microfluidic channels and tested from electrical and microfluidic point of view, achieving the micro-bio integration. Insertion of electrolyte plus acetilcholine into the channels leads to activation of the enzyme and the measurements are realized under the strict control of temperature and pH. The response time is about 10 minutes.

TI Three-Dimensional Encapsulation of Live Cells by Using a Hybrid Matrix
   of Nanoparticles in a Supramolecular Hydrogel
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB From a library of glyco-lipid mimics with muconic amide as the spacer, we found that 1, a glyco-lipid that has N-acetyl glucosamine and methyl cyclohexyl groups as its hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tails, respectively, formed a stable hydrogel (0.05 wt%) through hierarchical self-assembly of the lipid molecules into supramolecular nanofibers. The formation of the supramolecular hydrogel was verified by rheological measurements, and the supramolecular nanofiber was characterized as the structural element by transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy observations. Absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopic measurements revealed that the muconic amide moieties of I are arranged in a helical, stacked fashion in the self-assembled nanofibers. Moreover, we unexpectedly found that the homogeneous distribution of the supramolecular nanofibers of 1 was greatly facilitated by the addition of polystyrene nanobeads (100500 nm in diameter), as evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopic observations. It is interesting that the obtained supramolecular hybrid matrix can efficiently encapsulate and distribute live Jurkat cells in three dimensions under physiological conditions. This supramolecular hybrid matrix is intriguing as a unique biomaterial.

AB Monocytes are broadly discussed in the literature as cells, which can get properties of endothelial progenitor cells after angiogenic stimulation. Angiogenically stimulated monocytes can be used to promote implant vascularisation. A necessity therefore is that these cells can be stored and used after storage without a loose of their characteristic phenotype. In this study we tested, if freshly thawed cryopreserved human monocytes are positive for the mo/macrophage markers CD14 and CD68 and the endothelial marker CD31 after thawing and following angiogenic stimulation in a VEGF-A(165) enriched (10 ng/ml) angiogenic medium. Thereby the monocytes were tested before and after differentiation towards macrophages. The results revealed that freshly thawed human CD14 positive monocytes are positive for CD14, CD68 and CD31 after angiogenic stimulation. This CD specification was much more intense in the differentiated cells. The differentiation step also resulted in an increased cell count. Both results can be attributed to the method of differentiation, were cell culture bags were used instead of common cell culture dishes. Additionally the differentiation medium (X-VIVO 10 + 10% FCS) was specifically adapted to the requirements of monocytes/macrophages. The study showed that human CD14 positive monocytes can be thawed after cryopreservation without loss of their monocytes/macrophage phenotype and without loss of their ability to get angiogenically stimulated. To enhance the efficiency of both steps (thawing, angiogenic stimulation) it can be useful to differentiate the thawed cells in cell culture bags by the use of X-VIVO 10 (+ 10% FCS) before angiogenic stimulation.

AB The layer-by-layer technique was used to build-up polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) composed of heparin, an anionic glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and chitosan, a cationic biodegradable polysaccharide on model biomaterial surfaces. The surface coatings shall control adhesion of cells and thus their subsequent proliferation and differentiation. PEMs were characterized physicochemically by static contact angle and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements. Variations in procedure parameters such as the pH value of the solutions were crucial to the formation process and surface properties in terms of wettability and mass increase. Cell-surface interactions were studied with human fibroblast on PEMs. It was found that the pH value of solutions had a strong impact on cell adhesion making surfaces extremely cytophobic or moderately cytophilic. Adsorption of fibronectin to the terminal heparin layer could be used to increase cell adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner.

TI Histopathological observations of a polylactic acid-based device
   intended for guided bone/tissue regeneration
SO CLINICAL IMPLANT DENTISTRY AND RELATED RESEARCH
AB Background: Barrier devices have been shown to support alveolar bone and periodontal regeneration, a procedure also known as guided bone/tissue regeneration (GBR/GTR). Popular demand and clinical convenience have raised an interest in bioresorbable barrier devices. Tissue reactions to such bioresorbable devices are, however, generally not well explored.
   Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate short- and long-term tissue reactions following implantation of a bioresorbable polylactic acid (PLA)-based barrier device using a rat model.
   Materials and methods: Twenty-one young adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. The animals were divided into three groups including 15 animals receiving the PLA device and animals serving as sham surgery (five) or nonoperated (one) controls. Using aseptic techniques, the PLA device was surgically implanted in direct contact with the calvarial bone. Animals receiving the PLA device were sacrificed at 3, 5, 7, and 12 months postsurgery to provide longitudinal histopathological observations of tissue and biomaterials reactions. Control animals were sacrificed at 3 months.
   Results: Animals were maintained without adverse events. Sham surgery and nonoperated control animals showed no signs of new bone formation or resorption, or signs of inflammatory reactions in adjoining soft tissues. In contrast, extensive amounts of residual biomaterial with evidence of foreign body reactions and bone resorption were observed in animals receiving the PLA device over 12 months.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that the PLA device may induce bone resorbing foreign body reactions. Importantly, the PLA device does not resorb within a 12-month healing interval. These biomaterials properties may influence new bone formation and maintenance when applying the device for GBR/GTR.

SO COLORECTAL DISEASE
AB Objective This study reports the results of injectable silicone PTQ(TM) implants for faecal incontinence due to internal anal sphincter (IAS) dysfunction.
   Method Twenty patients (12 women) with partial faecal incontinence aged from 55 to 65 years were treated by a PTQ(TM) implant. All patients completed the Cleveland Clinic Continence and Quality of Life questionnaire. Endoluminal ultrasound and anorectal physiological testing were performed in each patient. All implants were inserted into the submucosal plane without ultrasound guidance.
   Results Faecal continence was significantly improved up to 1 year. The Wexner continence score fell from a median of 13.05 (range, 5-20) before treatment to 4.5 (range 2-7.7) at 1 month after (P < 0.005). This rose gradually to 6.2 (range, 0-16) at one year (P = 0.02) and 9.4 (range, 1-20) at 2 years (P = 0.127). There were no differences in resting or squeeze pressure before and at 3 months after treatment (P = 0.86 and P = 0.93). Fourteen (70%) patients experienced pruritus ani during the first few weeks after the procedure and one developed infection at the implant site.
   Conclusion Silicone implantation is minimally invasive and technically simple. It is effective over 1 year in the treatment of faecal incontinence due to IAS dysfunction.

AB The Mooney-Rivlin material model is evaluated for use in the non-linear finite element analysis of diaphragms made from biomedical grade polyurethane used in artificial hearts. Coefficients for the model are determined graphically from uniaxial and biaxial tensile data. The results are compared against published data for Biomer, a standard biomedical grade polyurethane. The evaluation shows that the Mooney-Rivlin model is inaccurate at low strains when used to represent the entire uniaxial stress-strain curve up to tensile failure. However, a more accurate representation of low strain is obtained when a specific strain range, (10% < epsilon < 50%), is used for modeling. This requirement of the model is relevant in diaphragm deformation, as strains are expected to be in this range.

AB gamma-Polyglutamic acid (gamma-PGA) is a hydrophilic, biodegradable, and naturally available biopolymer produced by a number of microbial species, most commonly, the Bacillaceae family. Its biological properties such as nontoxicity, biocompatibility, and nonimmunogenicity qualify it as an important biomaterial in drug delivery applications. This review focuses mainly on the development of gamma-PGA nanoparticles as drug delivery carriers for anticancer therapeutics.

TI Dental adhesion review: Aging and stability of the bonded interface
SO DENTAL MATERIALS
AB Objective. Most of current dental adhesive systems show favorable immediate results in terms of retention and sealing of bonded interface, thereby counteracting polymerization shrinkage that affects resin-based restorative materials. Despite immediate efficacy, there are major concerns when dentin bonded interfaces are tested after aging even for short time period, i.e. 6 months.
   Methods. This study critically discusses the latest peer-reviewed reports related to formation, aging and stability of resin bonding, focusing on the micro and nano-phenomena related to adhesive interface degradation.
   Results- Most simplified one-step adhesives were shown to be the least durable, while three-step etch-and-rinse and two-step self-etch adhesives continue to show the highest performances, as reported in the overwhelming majority of studies. In other words, a simplification of clinical application procedures is done to the detriment of bonding efficacy. Among the different aging phenomena occurring at the dentin bonded interfaces, some are considered pivotal in degrading the hybrid layer, particularly if simplified adhesives are used. insufficient resin impregnation of dentin, high permeability of the bonded interface, sub-optimal polymerization, phase separation and activation of endogenous collagenolytic enzymes are some of the recently reported factors that reduce the longevity of the bonded interface.
   Significance. In order to overcome these problems, recent studies indicated that (1) resin impregnation techniques should be improved, particularly for two-step etch-and-rinse adhesives; (2) the use of conventional multi-step adhesives is recommended, since they involve the use of a hydrophobic coating of nonsolvated resin; (3) extended curing time should be considered to reduce permeability and allow a better polymerization of the adhesive film; (4) proteases inhibitors as additional primer should be used to increase the stability of the collagens fibrils within the hybrid layer inhibiting the intrinsic collagenolytic activity of human dentin.

TI Polyelectrolyte biomaterial interactions provide nanoparticulate carrier
   for oral insulin delivery
SO DRUG DELIVERY
AB Nanospheres are being developed for the oral delivery of peptide-based drugs such as insulin. Mucoadhesive, biodegradable, biocompatible, and acid-protective biomaterials are described using a combination of natural polyelectrolytes, with particles formulated through nanoemulsion dispersion followed by triggered in situ gel complexation. Biomaterials meeting these criteria include alginate, dextran, chitosan, and albumin in which alginate/dextran forms the core matrix complexed with chitosan and albumin coat. Smaller size and higher albumin-based acid-protective formulation was orally administered to diabetic rats and glucose reduction and physiological response analyzed. Insulin encapsulation efficiency was 90, 82, and 66% for uncoated, chitosan-coated, and albumin-chitosan-coated alginate nanospheres, respectively. The choice of coating polymer seems to influence insulin release profile and to be crucial to prevent peptic digestion. Physiological response following oral delivery showed that insulin albumin-chitosan-coated alginate nanospheres reduced glycemia similar to 72% of basal values. Albumin serves as an important enteric coating providing acid- and protease protection enabling uptake of active drug following oral dosage.

TI PCA and multidimensional visualization techniques united to aid in the
   bioindication of elements from transplanted Sphagnum Palustre moss
   exposed in the Gdansk city area
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Goal, Scope and Background. During the last decades, a technique for assessing atmospheric deposition of heavy elements was developed based on the principle that samples of moss are able to accumulate elements and airborne particles from rain, melting snow and dry deposition. Despite a broad interest in bioindication there are still ongoing works aimed at the preparation of a standard procedure allowing for a comparison of research carried out in various areas. This is why the comparison of living and dry moss of the same species and growth site seems to be interesting, logical and promising. A most reliable approach seems to be the application of bioindication connected with multivariate statistics and efficient visualization techniques in the interpretation of monitoring data. The aim of this study was: (i) to present cumulative properties of transplanted Sphagnum palustre moss with differentiation into dry and living biomaterial; (ii) to determine and geographically locate types of pollution sources responsible for a structure of the monitoring data set; (iii) to visualize geographical distribution of analytes in the Gdansk metropolitan area and to identify the high-risk areas which can be targeted for environmental hazards and public health.
   Materials and Methods. A six month air pollution study based on Sphagnum palustre bioindication is presented and a simplified procedure of the experiment is given. The study area was located at the mouth of the Vistula River on the Baltic Sea, in Gdansk City (Poland). Sphagnum palustre was selected for research because of its extraordinary morphological properties and its ease in being raised. The capability of dry and living moss to accumulate elements characteristic for anthropogenic and natural sources was shown by application of Principal Component Analysis. The high-risk areas and pollution profiles are detected and visualized using surface maps based on Kriging algorithm.
   Results. The original selection of elements included all those that could be reliably determined by Neutron Activation Analysis in moss samples. Elimination of variables covered the elements whose concentrations in moss were lower than the reported detection limits for INAA for most observations or in cases where particular elements did not show any variation. Eighteen elements: Na, Ca, Sc, Fe, Co, Zn, As, Br, Mo, Sb, Ba, La, Ce, Sm, Yb, Lu, Hf, Th, were selected for the research presented.
   Discussion. Two runs of PCA were performed since, in the first-run a heavy polluted location (Stogi - 'Sto') understood as outlier in the term of PCA approach was detected and results in the form of block diagrams and surface maps were presented. As ensues from the first-run PCA analysis, the factor layout for both indicators is similar but not identical due to the differences in the elements accumulation mechanism. Three latent factors ('phosphatic fertilizer plant impact', 'urban impact' and 'marine impact') explain over 89% and 82% of the total variance for dry and living moss respectively. In the second-run PCA three latent factors are responsible for the data structure in both moss materials. However, in the case of dry moss analysis these factors explain 85% of the total variance but they are rather hard to interpret. On the other hand living moss shows the same pattern as in first-run PCA. Three latent factors explain over 84% of the total variance in this case. The pollution profiles extracted in PCA of dry moss data differ tremendously between both runs, while no deterioration was found after removal of Stogi from data set in case of living moss. Performance of the second-run PCA with exception of Stogi as a heavy polluted location has led to the conclusion that living moss shows better indication properties than dry one.
   Conclusions. While using moss as wet and dry deposition sampler it is not possible to calculate deposition values since the real volume of collected water and dust is hard to estimate due to a splash effect and irregular surface. Therefore, accumulation values seam to be reasonable for moss-based air pollution surveys. Both biomaterials: dry and living Sphagnum palustre show cumulative properties relative to elements under interest. Dry moss has a very loose collection of the atmospheric particles, which can also easily get lost upon rinsing with rainwater running through exposed dry moss material. The living moss may, on the contrary, incorporate the elements in its tissue, thus being less susceptible to rinsing and thus better reflecting the atmospheric conditions. Despite the differences in element uptake and uphold capabilities dry and living moss reflect characteristic anthropogenic and natural profiles. Visible differences in impacts' map coverage exist mostly due to the accumulation mechanisms differentiating dry from living moss. However, in case of each indicator 'phosphatic fertilizer plant impact' is recognized as the strongest pollution source present in examined region.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. General types of pollution sources responsible for a structure of monitoring data set were determined as high-risk/low-risk areas and visualized in form of geographic distribution maps. These locations can be targeted for environmental hazards and public health. Chemometric results in the form of easy defined surface maps can became a powerful instrument in hands of decision-makers working in the field of sustainable development implementation.

TI Synthesis and characterization of cyclic acetal based degradable
   hydrogels
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS AND BIOPHARMACEUTICS
AB While many synthetic, hydrolytically degradable hydrogels have been developed for biomedical applications, there are only a few examples whose polymer backbone does not form acidic products upon degradation. In order to address this concern, we proposed to develop a hydrogel based on a cyclic acetal unit that produces diols and propanals upon hydrolytic degradation. In particular, we proposed the fabrication of hydrogels formed by the free radical polymerization of two diacrylate monomers, 5-ethyl-5-(hydroxymethyl)-beta,beta-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-2-ethanol diacrylate (EHD), a cyclic acetal having two acryl groups, and poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate (PEGDA). However, the hydrophobicity of the EHD monomer inhibits hydrogel fabrication. Therefore this work develops a strategy to form hydrogels with a co-monomer system, one of which is hydrophobic, and subsequently describes the properties of the resulting hydrogel. Using benzoyl peroxide as an initiator and N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine as an accelerator, the EHD and PEGDA monomers were reacted in an acetone/water co-solvent system. The chemical structure of the resulting EH-PEG [5-ethyl-5-(hydroxymethyl)beta,beta-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-2-ethanol-co-PEG] hydrogel was then characterized by FT-IR. Physicochemical properties of the EH-PEG hydrogel, including swelling degree, sol fraction, and contact angle, were determined so as to characterize the properties of these materials and ultimately investigate their use in drug delivery and tissue engineering applications. Results showed that EH-PEG hydrogel may be formed using the co-solvent system. Further results indicated that swelling degree is dependent upon initiator concentration, monomer concentration, and molar ratios of monomers, while sol fraction significantly depended on initiator concentration and monomer concentration, only. These results demonstrate the ability to fabricate hydrogels using EHD and PEGDA system as well as to control the properties of the resulting hydrophilic networks. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

TI Physicochemical and cell adhesion properties of chitosan films prepared

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS AND BIOPHARMACEUTICS
AB This work was aimed at investigating a series of chitosan films obtained from chitosan, chitosan-phosphate, chitosan-phosphate-D(+)raffinose or chitosan-phosphate-D-(+) sucrose solutions to preliminarily select a suitable biomaterial for developing a cell substrate for tissue engineering. The prepared films were characterized in terms of physicochemical properties (FT-IR, XRD, optical microscopy, wettability, water absorption, and tensile stress) and effects on proliferation of different types of human cells (endothelial, HUVEC fibroblast, WI-38).
   The obtained results indicated that the presence of sucrose or raffinose at high concentration along with phosphate salts in the chitosan film-forming solution affords smooth, amorphous and highly hydrophilic materials in the form of soft and elastic film with optimal cytocompatibility.
   Owing to improved physicochemical and mechanical properties as well as affinity for differentiated human cells, these novel chitosan films appear as promising candidate biomaterials for tissue regeneration and repair.
   The major finding is the possibility to improve the biocompatibility of chitosan films by simply modifying their solid state characteristics. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Biomimetic material systems for neural progenitor cell-based therapy
SO FRONTIERS IN BIOSCIENCE-LANDMARK
AB Reconstruction and regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) following injury is a formidable task. However, cell replacement with transplanted neural progenitor cells (NPC) is a promising technique that has resulted in various levels of functional recovery in animals that had experienced an experimental injury of the brain or spinal cord. Unfortunately, CNS injury often leads to significant tissue damage and loss, limiting the survival and integration of transplanted NPC. In response, researchers have developed many biomaterial substrates that have been used to culture, transplant, and influence the differentiation and integration of transplanted NPC. Biomaterial scaffolds are a three-dimensional lattice that can be engineered to support NPC in vitro as well as serving as a temporary extracellular matrix (ECM) after transplantation. Scaffold modification with bioactive components, such as proteins, adhesive peptide sequences, and growth factors, allow researchers to modulate NPC responses as well as the local environment of the transplantation site. Biomimetic approaches also can include materials that recapitulate the structural dimensions of the ECM, namely self-assembling nanofibers. These materials can be useful for altering the tissue microenvironment by reducing inflammation and glial scarring, which may further enhance NPC survival and integration into functional neural circuitry. This review describes various biomaterial constructs, with a focus on biomimetic systems that have been used in modulating NPC behavior in culture and/or in transplanting NPC to the CNS.

FT-IR, XRD, SEM and Micro-CT were used to evaluate beta-TCP/DCHA and mineral phase structural ceramics before and after implantation. Osteoblasts were immersed in the bioceramics and implanted in the rabbit femora. The experimental results showed that new bone grown in beta-TCP/DCHA, and scaffolds were degraded with new bone formation and growth. The results indicated that beta-TCP/DCHA was a better tissue engineering material. A kind of biomaterial (beta-TCP/CHA) can be used for in situ formation or in vitro individuation formation. The experimental results indicated that beta-TCP/CHA possessed better osteoblast affinity. Osteoblasts can adhere, proliferate and grow better on the material. The experiments in vivo showed the materials bonded with osseous tissue. The implants were degraded obviously after 6 months, and new bone replaced degradation materials.

AB Hemocompatibility of a biomaterial is determined by the interactions between its surface and blood. Due to the complicated action mechanism, various effective ways and the multiple affective factors of the hemocompatibility, a comprehensive evaluation needs to be built instead of single index. Therefore, the platelet consumption ratio of 10 kinds of biomaterials including Ti6Al4V-TiC-DLC gradient coat material was studied based on image analysis method. Combined with the kinetic clotting time and the hemolysis ratio, the comprehensive hemocompatibility evaluation of the material is carried out based on the improved principal component analysis. First, linear transformation of negative index is carried out. Second, index is under a dimensionless using the logarithmic treatment, then to acquire all variants' principal component and their characteristic vectors. Finally, comprehensive evaluation index of hemocompatibility is constructed. The improved principal component analysis avoids the effect of correlativity among indexes during anaphase evaluation, and can more correctly maintain the original information of indexes. Thus, the research provides a new idea to the comprehensive evaluation of Hemocompatibility.

TI Foreign body response investigated with an implanted biosensor by in
   situ electrical impedance spectroscopy
SO IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
AB One of the principal challenges for the long-term implantation of biosensors is that the normal physiological response of the body creates a fibrotic capsule of scar tissue surrounding the implanted sensor (the foreign body response). This dense, collagenous capsule isolates the device from the local environment, causing a time-dependent degradation of the signal. We utilize this degradation or change to an electrical signal as an indicator of the physiological responses to the implantation of the biomaterial device. We thus track the foreign body response electronically, an important analytical method for our program that aims to reduce the foreign body response. We applied electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to track changes of the electrical signal behavior over time between micro-electrode arrays. We have performed experiments both in vitro and ex ova. In vitro, we used a reservoir of phosphate buffered saline into which selected proteins were introduced that adsorb onto the electrode surface. Three proteins were studied and each was found to affect the EIS results differently. We have investigated the foreign body response ex ova using the chick chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) model. Following implantation of the electrode array the chick CAM exhibited a response similar to the mammalian foreign body response. We report that the electrical signal degrades with tissue growth during the healing and remodeling following the traumatic implantation of the electrode needle through the ectoderm side of the CAM tissue.

TI Improvement in corrosion resistance of biomaterial alumina after 60 keV
   nitrogen ion implantation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY
AB Surface modification of polycrystalline alpha-alumina is carried out using ion implantation. Samples were implanted at 60 keV N+ ions with different ion doses ranging from 1 x 10(15) to 1 x 10(17) ions/cm(2). Corrosion resistance is studied in a Ringer solution. The increase in corrosion resistance is due to the compound formation studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and glancing-angle X-ray diffraction techniques. Nanohardness is more at a lower ion dose and decreases at a higher ion dose. Microstrutural investigation shows that the decrease in corrosion resistance and nanohardness at a higher ion dose is due to the damage accumulation at the surface.

AB The applicability of the biomaterial kudzu (Pueraria lobata ohwi) for the removal of the acid dye Erionil Marine Blau (EMB) from aqueous medium was investigated. The equilibrium results were described by the Langmuir and Freundlich models and the isotherms parameters were calculated. The experimental data were correlated better by the Freundlich model (R-2 = 0.9029). The effect of the system variables, initial sorbate concentration, mass of biosorbent, agitation rate and particle size, were examined. It was established that the biosorption of EMB on kudzu followed pseudo second order kinetics. The intraparticle diffusion model was also applied to explain the mechanism of dye molecules diffusion through the non-living biomass. The comparative estimation of the results proved the feasibility of using kudzu as an effective biosorbent for the removal of the acid dye EMB from aqueous phase. The highest obtained percent uptake of dye was 93%.

TI Impact of different texture of polypropylene mesh on the inflammatory
   response
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMMUNOPATHOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Over the past decade, hernia surgery has undergone a considerable transformation with the use of prosthetic materials. The most used polypropylene meshes induce a rapid acute inflammatory response followed by chronic foreign body reaction. Many factors influence this response such as density, size, physical characteristics, different texture and porosity of each biomaterial. The aim of this study is to assess whether the implant of monofilament or multifilament meshes, in the inguinal hernioplasty, determine a different inflammatory response. Thirty-two male patients were included in the study and were randomly divided into two groups. In the first group (MO) inguinal hernioplasty was performed using monofilament polypropylene mesh, while in the second one (MU) multifilament prosthesis was used. Peripheral venous blood samples were collected 24 hours before surgery and then 6, 24, 48 and 168 hours posto-peratively. Modifications in leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-1 antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-1 ra and IL-10 serum levels were recorded at all sampling times. We present evidence that serum levels of CRP, (alpha 1-AT), leukocytes and cytokines were significantly increased post-operatively in both groups, returning to basal values 168 hours afterwards. In particular, the production of all pro-inflammatory mediators was higher in the MU group, whereas the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10, IL-1ra) production was higher in MO patients. Our results indicate that polypropylene multifilament mesh allows a higher intense acute inflammatory response as compared to monofilament mesh implantation.

TI A study on properties of poly(3-hydroxylbutyrate-co-4-hydroxylbutyrate)
   with various 4HB contents and triethyl citrate plasticization
SO IRANIAN POLYMER JOURNAL
AB Sheets of poly(3-hydroxylbutyrate-co-4-hydroxylbutyrate)[P(3HB-co-4HB)] with various 4HB contents and triethyl citrate (TEC) plasticization are prepared by melt mixing and compression moulding. The thermal, crystalline and mechanical properties of these sheets are evaluated. Furthermore, fracture surfaces of samples plasticized by TEC are examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show that the increase of 4HB content can lead to the decrease of thermal parameters of samples such as melting temperature, glass transition temperature, crystalline temperature and crystallinity. However, the elongation-at-break of samples increases with the 4HB content increasing, and the strength-at-break decreases as a whole. The incorporation of 4HB units can improve the thermal stability of copolymer. The effect of TEC on the thermal and mechanical properties of samples is similar with that of 4HB unit. In contrast to 4HB unit, the increase of TEC content can worsen the thermal stability of samples. In addition, the copolymer of P(3HB-co-4HB) is compatible with TEC and its ductility can be improved by incorporation of TEC.

TI Staphylococcus epidermidis adhesion to modified polyearbonate surfaces:
   Gold and SAMs coated
SO JOURNAL OF ADHESION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Bacterial adhesion to a biomaterial surface is thought to be the key step in the infection of indwelling medical devices and constitutes an object of study in the demand to reduce nosocomial infections. In this work, specific modifications on polycarbonate outer layer were utilized as model surfaces for the study of the adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis, one of the main microorganisms responsible for nosocomial infections. The effect of gold coating on staphylococcal adhesion was assessed, as well as of subsequent coverage with different self-assembled monolayers (SAMs): two SAMs with a methyl terminal group and hydrophobic character and two hydrophilic SAMs with a carboxylic acid terminal group. Variations in the aliphatic chain length were also tested. A SAM with a calix-crown molecule was also created to immobilize a specific protein and its antibody. The extent of staphylococcal adhesion to methyl terminated SAMS was reduced compared to the number of cells adhered to the carboxyl acid terminated SAMs, demonstrating that methyl terminated SAMs constituted more suitable surfaces in preventing bacterial adhesion. The calix-crown molecule favours high levels of adhesion due to its non-specific bonding nature and geometrical configuration. However, when a specific protein is linked to calix-crown, bacterial adhesion occurs to a much lower extent. The results obtained in this work have a potential practical significance showing that the use of certain SAMs as surface modifiers may constitute a successful method in the reduction of bacterial adhesion to biomedical surfaces.

TI Antimicrobial potential of bioactive bone cements
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED BIOMATERIALS & BIOMECHANICS
AB Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) based bone cement is widely used to anchor artificial joints. In recent years, antibiotics have been incorporated in bone cements and administered systemically to either prevent or reduce the severity of infections. Certain antibiotics, such as tobramycin or vancomycin antibiotics have been incorporated at high concentrations into PMMA bone cements when dealing with infected hip joints, however, the inclusion of some antibiotics adversely affect the mechanical properties of the cement. Furthermore, studies have indicated that the incorporation of gentamicin in PMMA cements does not have a statistically significant effect on the biofilm formation of species such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Bioactive glasses have been shown to have numerous applications in the biomedical field because of their properties in bonding to both hard and soft tissues. Bioglass(R) undergoes surface dissolution in a physiological environment forming a hydroxycarbonate apatite layer and, in addition, exhibits the anti-inflammatory properties. Recent studies have shown that two paste bioactive bone cement systems that use Bioglass(R) as filler exhibit physical and mechanical properties comparable to PMMA cements with low polymerization exotherm and better mechanical properties with improved adhesion to bone and implant surfaces. In this study, Bioglass(R) containing two paste bone cements were investigated for their potential bacteriostatic properties and compared with PMMA cements with and without antibiotics. The results of this study indicated that the PMMA cement containing the antibiotic, gentamycin and the Bioglass(R) containing cements both pre- and post-immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) for brief periods showed the inhibition zones were not statistically significantly different in their average size for any of the three bacterial species, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. However, the PMMA cement without any antibiotic, namely gentamycin (CMW1) did not show any inhibition zones around the specimens for any of the three bacterial species. It was also noted that both Bioglass(R) filled bioactive cements immersed in SBF showed statistically significant increases in inhibition zones for all three specimens compared to specimens that were not immersed (p<0.001).

TI A computational modeling approach for the characterization of mechanical
   properties of 3D alginate tissue scaffolds
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED BIOMATERIALS & BIOMECHANICS
AB Scaffold guided tissue engineering is an innovative approach wherein cells are seeded onto biocompatible and biodegradable materials to form 3-dimensional (3D) constructs that, when implanted in the body facilitate the regeneration of tissue. Tissue scaffolds act as artificial extracellular matrix providing the environment conducive for tissue growth. Characterization of scaffold properties is necessary to understand better the underlying processes involved in controlling cell behavior and formation of functional tissue. We report a computational modeling approach to characterize mechanical properties of 3D gel-like biomaterial, specifically, 3D alginate scaffold encapsulated with cells. Alginate inherent nonlinearity and variations arising from minute changes in its concentration and viscosity make experimental evaluation of its mechanical properties a challenging and time consuming task. We developed an in silico model to determine the stress-strain relationship of alginate based scaffolds from experimental data. In particular, we compared the Ogden hyperelastic model to other hyperelastic material models and determined that this model was the most suitable to characterize the nonlinear behavior of alginate. We further propose a mathematical model that represents the alginate material constants in Ogden model as a function of concentrations and viscosity. This study demonstrates the model capability to predict mechanical properties of 3D alginate scaffolds.

TI Novel thermally sensitive pH-dependent chitosan/carboxymethyl cellulose
   hydrogels
SO JOURNAL OF BIOACTIVE AND COMPATIBLE POLYMERS
AB Temperature-responsive polymers are attractive candidates for applications related to injectable delivery of biologically active therapeutics. In this study, a novel approach to provide thermally sensitive neutral solutions based on chitosan/carboxymethyl cellulose (Ch/CMC) combinations is described. The potential of thermosensitive Ch/CMC as a biomaterial is evaluated for the culture of chondrocytes, with the goal of using the Ch/CMC polymer as an injectable matrix/cell therapeutic. These formulations possess a physiological pH and can be held as liquid below room temperature for encapsulating living cells. At body temperature they form monolithic gels, thus injected in vivo, the liquid formulations turn into gel implants in situ. The sols/gels have been thoroughly characterized for rheology and morphology analysis. The use of Ch/CMC aqueous solutions as gelling systems is a new discovery of a new family of thermosetting gels highly compatible with biological compounds.

TI Preparation and characterization of nano-hydroxyapatite/silk fibroin
   porous scaffolds
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB Novel tissue engineering scaffold materials of nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA)/silk fibroin (SF) biocomposite were prepared by freeze-drying. The needle-like nHA crystals of about 10 nm in diameter by 50-80 nm in length, which were uniformly distributed in the porous nHA/SF scaffolds, were prepared by a co-precipitation method with a size. The as-prepared nHA/SF scaffolds showed good homogeneity, interconnected pores and high porosity. XRD and FT-IR analysis suggested that the silk fibroin was in beta-sheet structure, which usually provides outstanding mechanical properties for silk materials. In this work, composite scaffolds containing as high as 70% (w/w) nHA were prepared, which had excellent compressive modulus and strength, higher than the scaffolds at low nHA content level and other porous biodegradable polymeric scaffolds often considered in bone-related tissue engineering reported previously. The cell compatibility of composite scaffolds was evaluated through cell viability by MTT assay. All these results indicated that these nHA/SF scaffold materials may be a promising biomaterial for bone tissue engineering.

TI Physical properties and biocompatibility of cellulose/soy protein
   isolate membranes coagulated from acetic aqueous solution
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB Aseries of cellulose/soy protein isolate (SPI) membranes was prepared from cellulose and SPI solution by casting and coagulation from 5 wt% acetic acid and 5 wt% sulphuric acid aqueous solution, respectively. The structure and properties of the membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and tensile testing. The effects of SPI content (W-SPI) and the coagulants on the structure and properties of the membranes were investigated. The membranes exhibited porous structure. The pore size in the surfaces and cross-sections of the membranes increased with an increase of WSPI regardless of the coagulants. The membranes containing 10 wt% WSPI showed higher tensile strength and elongation at break than other membranes. The membranes with the same WSPI coagulated from acetic acid solution exhibited higher values of tensile strength, elongation at break and pore size in the surfaces and cross-sections than those corresponding membranes coagulated from sulphuric acid. The biocompatibility of the acetic acid-coagulated membranes was preliminarily evaluated by cell culture and in vivo implantation experiments. The results revealed that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECV304) grew well on this biomaterial. In comparison with the pure cellulose membrane, because of the incorporation of SPI and the resultant alteration of microstructure, the SPI-modified membranes showed an improved in vivo biocompatibility and biodegradability in the implantation experiments. These cellulose/SPI membranes warrant further explorations in biomedical fields.

TI Improved blood compatibility of poly(ethylene terephthalate) films
   modified with L-arginine
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB In order to improve the blood compatibility of the commonly used blood- contacting biomaterial poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), in this study PET films were chemically modified with L-arginine (L-Arg) by a three-step-procedure using glutaraldehyde (GA) as a cross-linker. The composition and chemical structure of PET and its change with surface modification were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FT-IR) spectroscopy, while the change in hydrophilicity was judged by water contact angles measurement. The result of water contact measurement indicated that the modified films became more hydrophilic than PET with the contact angle decreasing from 78.5. for PET to 43.7. for PET-Arg. The protein adsorption on the film surface was evaluated by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) method, and the result showed that the L-Arg-modified films decreased the amount of protein adsorption by about 25%. The in vitro blood compatibility such as platelet adhesion (observed by scanning electron microscopy) and thrombus formation was also investigated, and the results demonstrated that the L-Arg-modified films significantly suppressed platelet adhesion and aggregation and reduced the thrombus formation by about 67% compared with PET.

TI Characterization of neural stem cells on electrospun
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone) submicron scaffolds: evaluating their
   potential in neural tissue engineering
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB Development of biomaterials with specific characteristics to influence cell behaviour has played an important role in exploiting strategies to promote nerve regeneration. The effect of three-dimensional (3D) non-woven electrospun poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds on the behaviour of rat brain-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) is reported. The interaction of NSCs on the randomly orientated submicron (PCL) fibrous scaffolds, with an average fibre diameter of 750 +/- 100 nm, was investigated. The PCL scaffolds were modified with ethylenediamine (ED) to determine if amino functionalisation and changes in surface tension of the fibrous scaffolds affected the proliferation and differentiation characteristics of NSCs. Surface tension of the fibrous scaffold increased upon treatment with ED which was attributed to amine moieties present on the surface of the fibres. Although surface treatment did not change the differentiation of the NSCs, the modified scaffolds were more hydrophilic, resulting in a significant increase in the number of adhered cells, and increased spreading throughout the entirety of the scaffold. When the NSCs were seeded on the PCL scaffolds in the presence of 10% FBS, the stem cells differentiated primarily into oligodendrocytes, indicating that electrospun PCL has the capacity to direct the differentiation of NSCs towards a specific lineage. The data presented here is useful for the development of electrospun biomaterial scaffolds for neural tissue engineering, to regulate the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs.

TI Reduced foreign body reaction to implanted biomaterials by surface
   treatment with oriented osteopontin

CT Symposium on Biomaterials from 2D to 3D to Larger than Life
CY DEC 14-17, 2006
CL Maui, HI
AB The foreign body reaction (FBR), which leads to the encapsulation of implanted biomaterials, has been implicated in the failure of many medical devices. The protein layer that is non-specifically adsorbed onto the implant surface immediately after implantation is thought to dictate this reaction. It is hypothesized that biomaterial surfaces having specific proteins with precisely controlled orientations will decrease the FBR. Previously, we have reported that osteopontin (OPN) adsorbed on positively charged surfaces has a preferable orientation for in vitro cell adhesion and spreading as compared to negatively charged surfaces. It is expected that coating a layer of OPN in its prefer-red orientation on an implant surface will decrease the FBR. In this work, in vivo studies were performed to test this hypothesis. A positively charged polymer (p(HEMA-co-AEMA)) and a negatively charged polymer (p(HEMA-co-CEA)) coated with OPN were implanted subcutaneously in wild-type mice for 7 or 28 days. Uncoated polymers were used as control. For the 7-day implants, cells on OPN-coated p(HEMA-co-AEMA) spread more than cells on the other three materials. Following 28 days of implantation the implants were explanted and the capsule thickness and vascularity around the implants were characterized. Additionally, the macrophage and foreign body giant cells (FBGCs) around the implants were quantified. It was found in this study that the modification of the positively charged polymer surface with OPN in a controlled orientation led to a reduction in the foreign body reaction as determined by capsule thickness. Our finding provides valuable information for designing better biocompatible biomaterials with improved in vivo performance.

TI Behaviour of human mesenchymal stem cells on a polyelectrolyte-modified
   HEMA hydrogel for silk-based ligament tissue engineering
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB The aim of this study was to design a functional bio-engineered material to be used as scaffold for autologous mesenchymal stem cells in ligament tissue engineering. Polyelectrolyte-modified HEMA hydrogel (HEMA-co-METAC), applied as coating on silk fibroin fibres, has been formulated in order to take advantage of the biocompatibility of the polyelectrolyte by increasing its mechanical properties with silk fibres. Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells behaviour on such reinforced polyelectrolyte has been studied by evaluating cell morphology, cell number, attachment, spreading and proliferation together with collagen matrix production and its mRNA expression. Silk fibroin fibres matrices with HEMA-co-METAC coating exhibited acceptable mechanical behaviour compared to the natural ligament, good human mesenchymal stem cell adhesion and with mRNA expression studies higher levels of collagen types I and III expression when compared to control cells on polystyrene. These data indicate high expression of mRNA for proteins responsible for the functional characteristics of the ligaments and suggest a potential for use of this biomaterial in ligament tissue-engineering applications.

   3HB-co-4HB-co-3HHx, consisting of 3-hydroxybutyrate, 4-hydroxybutyrate
   and 3-hydroxyhexanoate
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB A terpolyester consisting of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB), 4-hydroxybutyrate (4HB) and 3-hydroxyhexanoate (3HHx), abbreviated as P(3HB-co-4HB-co-3HHx), was studied for possible application as an implant biomaterial. L929 mouse fibroblasts, MC3T3-E1 murine osteoblasts and a human cell line of immortalized human keratinocyte (HaCat cells) were used to study the biocompatibility of P(3HB-co-4HB-co-3HHx). Cell morphology and cell activity were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the MTT assay, respectively. All three cell types showed higher activities when grown on films of P(3HB-co-4HB-co-3HHx) compared with their growth on poly(lactic acid) (PLA), co-polyester PHBHHx films and on polylysine-coated plates (blank), respectively. The three cell types grown on the terpolyester also demonstrated a well-spread cell shape and large number of pseudopods due to strong cell-cell and cell-material interactions. It was clearly observed that P(3HB-co-4HB-co-3HHx) had a much faster degradation rate than PHBHHx after 15 weeks of incubation in phosphate-buffered saline under dynamic conditions. The results proved that the terpolyester had favorable biocompatibility and biodegradability compared with the well-studied polyesters PLA and PHBHHx.

TI Physical adsorption of human thrombomodulin (ART-123) onto polymeric
   biomaterials for developing an antithrombogenic blood-contacting
   material
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Human thrombomodulin (hTM) is an endothelial cell-associated protein with potent natural anticoagulant activity by converting thrombin from a procoagulant protease to an anticoagulant. ART-123 is a recombinant soluble hTM (amino acid residues 1-498), and we focused on the physical adsorption of ART-123 onto a polymeric biomaterial surface to develop an antithrombogenic blood-contacting material with preventing the denaturation of hTM and the remaining chemical reagents. The adsorption of hTM onto polysulfone (PSF) films was analyzed quantitatively by quartz crystal microbalance analysis. The adsorption constant and the maximum adsorption amount, calculated by the assumption of a Langmuir-type adsorption, showed that hTM adsorbed with a relatively weak interaction onto the PSF film. The hydrophilic protein lysozyme also showed a Langmuir-type monolayer adsorption, although hydrophobic catalase and fibrinogen showed multilayer adsorption accompanying the denaturation. The physically adsorbed hTM showed high coenzymatic activity for the activation of protein C, as well as anticoagulant activity. Furthermore, the surface, wettability of the PSF film was easily controllable by the physical adsorption of hydrophobic and hydrophilic bioactive proteins. The physical adsorption of hTM or bioactive proteins onto polymeric biomaterials will be instrumental for developing an antithrombogenic blood-contacting biomaterial, and for controlling the surface properties of biomaterials.

AB On the basis of the bioactivity of hydroxyapatite (HA) and the excellent mechanical and biocompatible performance of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), composite microfibers made of nanograde HA with PET was designed and fabricated to mimic the structure of biological bone, which exhibits a composite of nanograde apatite crystals and natural polymer. The PET/HA nanocomposite was molded into fibers so that the bulk structures' mechanical properties can be custom tailored by changing the final 3D orientation of the fibbers. This study focused on the in vitro biocompatibility evaluation of the PET/HA composite fibers as potential bone fixation biomaterial for total hip replacement prosthesis surfaces. The MTT assay was performed with the extracts of the composite fibers in order to evaluate the short-term effects of the degradation products. The cell morphology of L929 mouse fibroblast cell line was analyzed after direct contact with the fiber scaffolds for different time periods, and the cell viability was also analyzed by the Alamar Blue assay. The release of the inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), from RAW 264.7 macrophages in the presence of fiber extracts and fibers was used as a measure of the inflammatory response. The ability of the fiber matrices to support L929 attachment, spreading, and growth in vitro, combined with the compatible degradation extracts and low inflammation potential of the fibers and extracts, suggests potential use of these fibers as load-baring bone fixation biomaterial structures.

TI Effect of hydroxyapatite coating and polymethylmethacrylate on stainless
   steel implant-site infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis in a sheep
   model
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB We aimed to study the influence of hydroxyapatite (HA) coating and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement on the risk of development of stainless steel implant-site infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis in a sheep model. Uncoated, HA-coated, and PMMA-cemented stainless steel implants were inserted in the left femur of 30 sheep. For each type of implant, sheep were inoculated with S. epidermidis in the intramedullary canal and one non-inoculated group was used as control. After 6 weeks, infection was evaluated using clinical, radiological, bacteriological, and histological criteria. Radiological and clinical results were normal. Cultures were negative in the control sheep. In the inoculated sheep, interposition tissue and bone cultures were positive in 2 of 6 uncoated, 6 of 6 HA, and 6 of 6 PMMA implants with a mean bacteria count of 5.2 +/- 1.17, 3.5 +/- 0.7, and 3.9 +/- 0.9 loglo cfu/g, respectively (NS), for interposition tissue, and 4 +/- 0.01, 2.9 +/- 0.6, and 2.5 +/- 1.3 log(10) cfu/g, respectively (NS) for bone. The polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) score (mean number of PMN per 10 different microscopic high-power fields >= 5) in interposition tissue was >= 3 in 6 of 6 HA, significantly different from uncoated (3 of 6) and PMMA (2 of 6) groups (p = 0.04). The HA and PMMA inoculated groups had a higher infection rate than the uncoated inoculated group (p = 0.06). In this experimental sheep model of S. epidermidis infection at the bone-biomaterial interface, HA seems to be at higher risk of infection compared with uncoated or PMMA-cemented stainless steel, when inoculation is intramedullary and contemporary with implantation.

TI Spatial distribution of mineralized bone matrix produced by marrow
   mesenchymal stem cells in self-assembling peptide hydrogel scaffold
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB We evaluated the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) using a new class of synthetic self-assembling peptide hydrogels, RADA 16, as a scaffold for three-dimensional culture. MSCs derived from rat bone marrow were culture-expanded and seeded into the hydrogel and further cultured in osteogenic medium containing P-glycerophosphate, ascorbic acid, and dexamethasone for 2 - 4 weeks. High alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin (OC) contents were detected at both the protein and gene expression levels during the culture periods. Both calcium and the OC contents increased over time, indicating the growth of a mineralized extracellular matrix within the hydrogel. Moreover, the process of the growth of the mineralized matrix determined by three-dimensional microarchitecture images was obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The findings show that MSCs can differentiate into mature osteoblasts to form mineralized matrices within the hydrogel scaffold. Importantly, the differentiation can occur three dimensionally within the hydrogel, indicating that RADA 16 can be considered attractive synthetic biomaterial for use in bone tissue engineering.

TI Matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in the foreign body
   reaction on biomaterials
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can degrade structural components within the extracellular matrix and at the cellular surface producing changes in cellular behavior (i.e., adhesion and migration) and subsequent pathological responses (i.e., the foreign body reaction and wound healing). We continue to study the foreign body reaction that occurs following biomaterial implantation by investigating secretory responses of biomaterial-adherent macrophages and foreign body giant cells (FBGCs) as directed by material surface chemistry and further this research by determining whether secreted MMPs, play a role in macrophage adhesion and fusion. We have identified numerous MMPs and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) in in vitro cell-culture supernatants using antibody arrays and quantified select MMP/TIMPs with ELISAs. MMP-9 concentrations were significantly greater than both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 on all materials. The ratios of MMP-9/TIMP-1 and MMP-9/TIMP-2 increased with time because of an increase in MMP-9 concentrations over time, while the TIMP concentrations remained constant. Total MMP-9 concentrations in the supernatants were comparable on all materials at each timepoint, while TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 concentrations tended to be greater on hydrophilic/anionic surfaces. Analysis of the MMP/TIMP quantities produced per cell revealed that the hydrophilic/neutral surfaces, which inhibited macrophage adhesion, activated the adherent macrophages/FBGCs to produce a greater quantity of MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 per cell. Pharmacological inhibition of MMP-1,-8,-13, and -18 reduced macrophage fusion without affecting adhesion, while inhibitors of MMP-2,-3,-9, and -12 did not affect adhesion or fusion. These findings demonstrate that material surface chemistry does modulate macrophage/FBGC-derived MMP/TIMP secretion and implicates MMP involvement in macrophage fusion.

TI Osteoblast interactions with various hydroxyapatite based biomaterials
   consolidated using a spark plasma sintering technique
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS
AB This study investigated the osteoblast behaviors on various hydroxyapatite based biomaterials that were consolidated at 1100 degrees C for 3 min by a spark plasma sintering technique. The osteoblasts from human fetal osteoblast cell line were cultured in the medium on the various biomaterials surfaces (HA, RF21, 1SiHA, and 5SiHA) to assess the cell morphology and proliferation as well as cell differentiation (alkaline phosphatase activity). Moreover, the bone gamma-carboxyglutamic protein or osteocalcin in the medium were determined at different periods of culture. The present results indicated that the amount of osteocalcin in the medium decreased during the periods of culture. The highest osteocalcin production obtained from the biomaterial 5SiHA after cell culture for 2 days demonstrated that the presence of silica in the biomaterials enhanced the cell differentiation by the rapid release of silicate and calcium ions.

TI Formation of filamentous appendages by Acinetobacter sp Tol 5 for
   adhering to solid surfaces
SO JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCE AND BIOENGINEERING
AB The toluene-degrading bacterium Acinetobacter sp. Tol 5 is highly adhesive to solid surfaces owing to two filamentous cell appendages, namely, anchors and peritrichate fibrils. When growing this bacterium in the presence of a carrier made of polyurethane foam, almost all the cells adhered to the surface of the carrier. In contrast, when Tol 5 cells were grown in the absence of the polyurethane carrier, the cells were suspended as aggregated cells or individually dispersed cells. The aggregated cells possessed the cell appendages and showed an adhesiveness similar to that of cells grown in the presence of the carrier, while the dispersed cells scarcely produced the cell appendages and showed a low level of adhesiveness. The dispersed cells started to adhere to the polyurethane carrier by producing the filamentous appendages within 30 min of the addition of the carrier as a substratum and toluene as a carbon source. Peritrichate fibrils just sprouting and growing anchors longer than 3 pm were observed when the cells started to adhere. This suggests that the presence of surface areas sufficient for adhesion might trigger cell appendage formation in Tol 5 cells for adhesion by increasing the amount of cell contact with the surfaces.

AB PURPOSE: To compare the adherence and biofilm formation of Staphylococcus epidermidis under in vitro flow conditions on intraocular lenses (IOLs) made of 4 biomaterials: poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), silicone, hydrophilic acrylic, and hydrophobic acrylic.
   SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Croix-Rousse University Hospital and University Research Laboratory, Lyon, France.
   METHODS: Intraocular lenses were placed in a bioreactor designed to replicate intraocular conditions. The model consisted of Tygon tubing connected to a vial. Three septa allowed the entry and elimination of the artificial aqueous humor and inoculation of the bacterial suspension. The first of 2 pumps moved the aqueous humor along the circuit; the second pump regulated the flow at which the nutritive environment was regenerated. At various times (12, 16, 24, 40, 48, 60, and 72 hours), IOLs were taken from this environment and the bound bacteria were removed and counted. The distribution of bacterial adhesion on the IOLs was modeled using polynomial Poisson regression. To test the effect of the IOL biomaterial on bacterial adhesion, likelihood ratio tests were performed.
   RESULTS: The model provided the kinetics of S epidermidis biofilm growth on IOLs. The biofilm growth on each of the 4 biomaterials occurred in 3 phases: latent, dynamic or accelerated growth, and linear growth. The extent of bacterial binding to IOLs increased from hydrophilic acrylic polymer to PMMA, hydrophobic acrylic, and silicone. The differences were statistically significant.
   CONCLUSION: Bacterial adhesion to and biofilm development on the IOL surface depended on the characteristics of the biomaterial.

TI XAS and XPS studies on chromium-binding groups of biomaterial during
   Cr(VI) biosorption
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB The reduction of toxic Cr(VI) to the less or nontoxic Cr(III) may be an useful detoxification technique for the treatment of Cr(VI)-contaminated waters. Recently, the protonated biomass of brown seaweed, Ecklonia, was shown to completely reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in the pH range 1-5. The reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) appeared to occur at the surface of the biomass. In this study, abiotic Cr(VI) reduction by the biomass was performed with various contact times, pHs and initial Cr(VI) concentrations, and surface and bulk characteristics of the Cr-laden biomass was then investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The XPS spectra indicated that the Cr(VI) bound to the biomass was completely reduced to Cr(III) at tested various conditions. XANES and EXAFS spectra of the Cr-laden biomass were very similar to those of Cr(Ill)-acetate, which means that the Cr bound to the biomass during Cr(VI) reduction had an octahedral geometrical arrangement. The bonding distance of the chromium oxygen atoms was approximately 1.97-1.99 angstrom. In conclusion, it was obvious that oxygen containing groups, such as carboxyl and phenolic groups, play a major role in the binding of the Cr(III) resulting from the abiotic reduction of Cr(VI) by the biomass.

TI An anorganic bioceramic matrix for use as scaffold in bone regeneration:
   pharmaceutical development and preliminary biological evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF DRUG DELIVERY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Regenerative medicine is an interdisciplinary field involving biology, medicine and engineering. It is focused on the repair, regeneration or replacement of cells, tissues or organs in order to restore their biological functionality to improve patients' quality of life. The purpose of this work was to develop an anorganic bioceramic matrix obtained from natural and traceable bovine bones capable of acting as a scaffold and as a mineral reservoir for guided bone heating. The manufacturing process used went through several stages in order to assure the removal of all organic components. The products obtained were analyzed and a biological evaluation performed. An anorganic matrix derived from bovine bones with morphology similar to human cancellous bone was obtained. The biological evaluation has shown that the material was well integrated to the tissue with no signs of inflammation and the beginning of new bone formation. This biomaterial appears to be a promising candidate for future applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery as a scaffold with a porous structure.

TI Electrospun Fibrinogen-Polydioxanone Composite Matrix: Potential for In
   Situ Urologic Tissue Engineering
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERED FIBERS AND FABRICS
AB Our objective is to demonstrate an electrospun fibrinogen-PDO (polydioxanone) composite scaffold will retain the superior cellular interaction of fibrinogen while producing a product with the functional strength needed for direct implantation. Fibrinogen-PDO composite scaffolds were electrospun with PDO ratios of 0% (pure fibrinogen), 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 100% (pure PDO) and disinfected using standard methods. Scaffolds were seeded with human BSM (bladder smooth muscle cells) and incubated with twice weekly media changes. Samples were removed at 7, 14 and 21 days for evaluation by collagen assay, scanning electron microscopy and histology. Cell seeding and culture demonstrated human BSM readily migrate throughout and remodel electrospun fibrinogen-PDO composite scaffolds with deposition of native collagen. Cell migration and collagen deposition increased with increasing fibrinogen concentration while scaffold integrity increased with increasing PDO concentration. Electrospun fibrinogen-PDO composite structures promote rapid cellular in-growth by human BSM while maintaining structural integrity. The fibrinogen to PDO ratio can be adjusted to achieve the desired properties required for a specific tissue engineering application. Our ultimate objective is to utilize this innovative biomaterial technology to produce an acellular, bioresorbable product that enables in situ tissue regeneration. While there is still much work to be done, these initial findings indicate fibrinogen-PDO composite scaffolds deserve further investigation.

TI Photochemical Processes Involved in a Biopolymer Doped by Chromium(VI)
   during Hologram Recording
SO JOURNAL OF MACROMOLECULAR SCIENCE PART A-PURE AND APPLIED CHEMISTRY
AB This paper is devoted to the study of the photochemical processes occurring during hologram formation in a biopolymer, agar doped by chromium(VI). The evolution of both the absorbing chromium species and the polymer allowed elucidating the reactions taking place during irradiation in conditions representative of hologram formation. As previously observed with dichromated poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), polymer containing hydroxyl groups as agar, irradiation of dichromated agar provoked a two step reduction of chromium species and the crosslinking of the host polymer. But agar has a rather complex chemical structure and the photoproducts formed along the polymeric chains throughout the photoredox process were different in agar and in PVA. The photostability of the matrix, that has been proven, coupled with the possibility to record good quality holograms, allowed us to propose dichromated agar as a new natural photosensitive biomaterial.

AB The design and construction of synthetic self-assembled nanostructures is, in a large part, inspired from elaborate nanostructures in biological systems. If we look at it from another angle, the self-assembled nanostructures are excellent scaffolds for exploring and modulating biological phenomena when they are suitably functionalized with bioactive molecules. Of the many types of molecular building blocks for self-assembly, peptide-based building blocks have the advantage in that their constituent amino acids are biocompatible and the sequence space of peptide chains is vast. This contribution highlights an emerging approach to the biomaterial application of artificially designed and functional beta-sheet peptide self-assemblies.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB Bone regeneration in infected tissue or areas with high bacteria concentrations such as the oral cavity requires combining disinfection with biomaterial properties. Classical antibiotics typically provide excellent short term protection against re-infection of a defect but are typically washed out of an operation site within days. The present work investigates the use of silver on amorphous tricalcium phosphate (TCP) nanoparticles for electrospun, highly porous poly(lactide-co-glyclolide) (PLGA) fibrous composites. In vitro bioactivity tests of the wool-like composite PLGA/Ag-TCP (80 : 20) containing 0.5 wt% silver showed rapid hydroxyapatite deposition on the nanocomposite within 2 days. Antibacterial tests using E. coli demonstrated a strongly prolonged antibacterial effect of the scaffolds containing finely dispersed silver on TCP if compared to current clinically used methods based on soaking the scaffolds with a tetracycline solution prior to implantation.

TI Calcium phosphate nanoparticles in biomineralization and biomaterials
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB Recent developments in biomineralization and biomaterials have demonstrated that nano-calcium phosphate particles play an important role in the formation of hard tissues in nature. It is suggested that the basic inorganic building blocks of bone and enamel are nanosized apatite although their hierarchical structures differ. Nanoparticles can confer on biominerals remarkable physical and chemical characteristics such as enhanced mechanical strength and self-preservation in biological fluids. In living organisms, tens to hundreds of nano-blocks, under the control of an organic matrix, combine into self-assembled biominerals. It is also confirmed experimentally that enamel- or bone-like apatite can be achieved by oriented aggregation by using nano-calcium phosphates as the raw materials, determined by the biomolecules. Interestingly, features of smaller hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanoparticles may more closely approximate features of HAP during biomineralization than features of the larger HAP particles that are conventionally used. The application and prospective use of nano-calcium phosphate in the biological repair of bone and enamel are also introduced. It is emphasized that the cell experiments reveal improved cytophilicity of nanophase calcium phosphate minerals. Greater cell viability and proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are measured on smaller calcium phosphates. Furthermore, studies of amorphous calcium phosphate and crystallized HAP particles are used to investigate the effect of crystallinity of nanoparticles on living cells, and show that the differentiation of stem cells is promoted significantly by nano-HAP. It is suggested that nano-HAP may be the ideal biomaterial due to its good biocompatibility and bone/enamel integration. Lots of studies of calcium phosphates are expected in the nano-zone such as for drug delivery systems and resorbable scaffolds. In this feature article, a new view on calcium phosphates highlights the importance of size and phase controls in the application of biomedical materials.

AB In the present work we aimed to develop and characterize hybrid organic-inorganic materials based on poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) polymer chemically modified by organosilanes and crosslinked network to be tested as solid support on immunoassay application. Hybrids were synthesized by reacting PVA with 5 different alkoxysilanes modifying chemical groups: tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane (MPTES), 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS), 3-(triethoxysilyl)propylisocyanate (TESPI), and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). PVA-derived hybrids were also modified by chemically crosslinking with glutaraldehyde (GA) during the synthesis reaction. In order to investigate the structure in the nanometer-scale, PVA-derived hybrids were characterized by using small-angle X-ray scattering synchrotron radiation (SAXS). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to investigate PVA hybrids chemical functionalities and their interaction with bovine herpesviruses. The morphology of silane modified PVA films were also analyzed by SEM coupled to EDX. The bioactivity assays were tested through Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) with bovine herpesvirus (BoHV). SAXS results have indicated nano-ordered disperse domains for PVA hybrids with different X-ray scattering patterns for PVA polymer and PVA-derived hybrids. FTIR spectra have clearly showed that the proposed modifications of PVA by organosilanes were obtained. The chemical crosslinking of PVA polymer chain by GA was verified by FTIR. The immunoassay results have showed that PVA hybrids with chemically functionalized structures have played an important role on regulating to some extent the interaction of herpesvirus and solid substrate at the interface. These results have given strong evidence that PVA-derived hybrid nanocomposites were successfully formed with GA crosslinked network. Also, such PVA based material could be advantageously used in immunoassays with enhanced specificity for diagnosis.

AB Investigation of novel biomaterials for bone engineering is based on the development of porous scaffolds, which should match the properties of the tissue that is to be replaced. These materials need to be biocompatible, ideally osteoinductive, osteoconductive, and mechanically well-matched. In the present paper, we report the preparation and characterization of hybrid macroporous scaffold of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/bioactive glass through the sol-gel route. Hybrids containing PVA (80, 70 and 60 wt%) and bioactive glass with composition 58SiO(2)-33CaO-9P(2)O(5) were synthesized by foaming a mixture of polymer solution and bioactive glass via sol-gel precursor solution. PVA with two different degree of hydrolysis (DH), 98.5% (high degree) and 80% (low degree) were also investigated, in order to evaluate the influence of residual acetate group present in polymer chain on the final structure and properties of 3D porous composite produced. The microstructure, morphology and crystallinity of the hybrid porous scaffolds were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Infrared Fourier Transform spectrometry (FTIR) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDX) analysis. In addition, specific surface area was assessed by B.E.T. nitrogen adsorption method and mechanical behavior was evaluated by compression tests. Preliminary cytotoxicity and cell viability were also performed by the MTT assay. VERO cell monolayers were grown in 96-well microtiter plates. The results have clearly showed that hybrid foams of polyvinyl alcohol/bioactive glass (PVA/BG) with interconnected macroporous 3D structure were successfully produced. All the tested hybrids of PVA/BG have showed adequate cell viability properties for potential biological applications.

TI Extracorporeal hydroxyapatite-chamber for bone and biomaterial studies
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB Hydroxyapatite (HA) spherules and autologous bone (AB) with a central vascular pedicle were housed inside an HA-chamber to form the skeletal segment of specific shape. Experimental chambers were then inserted in a pocket between medial thigh muscles in 13 New Zealand male rabbits for 3 months. Three graft group were scheduled: (A) HA and AB without vascular pedicle, (B) HA with vascular pedicle, (C) HA and AB with vascular pedicle. At term, histology showed tissue and cellular degeneration in group A chambers. Due to spherules coalescence, fibrous tissue is formed in group B chambers. Group C chambers contained living osteocytes in the implanted bone, several newly formed vessels in soft tissue, bone and partial hydroxyapatite erosions. New bone was formed in apposition to both autologous bone and hydroxyapatite. Our study suggests that this experimental model could be used to grow adequately sized vascularized skeletal segments.

TI Mineralised collagen - an artificial, extracellular bone matrix -
   improves osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB In the field of bone tissue engineering there is a high demand on bone graft materials which promote bone formation. By combination of collagen type I with nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (HA) we generated a resorbable material which structure and composition is close to those of the extracellular bone matrix. This nanocomposit material was produced in a biomimetic process in which collagen fibril assembly and mineralisation with hydroxyapatite occur simultaneously. In this study the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived stromal cells (hBMSC) on membranes of biomimetically mineralised collagen type I was investigated. To this end, we optimised biochemical assays for determination of cell number and alkaline phosphatase activity corresponding to the special properties of this biomaterial. For cell experiments hBMSC were seeded on the mineralised collagen membranes and cultivated over 35 days, both in static and perfusion culture, in the presence and absence of dexamethasone, beta-glycerophosphate and ascorbate. Compared to cells grown on tissue culture polystyrene we found attenuated proliferation rates, but markedly increased activity of alkaline phosphatase on the mineralised collagen indicating its promoting effect on the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSC. Therefore this bone-like material may act as a suitable artificial extracellular matrix for bone tissue engineering. Perfusion of the 2D cell matrix constructs with cell culture medium did not improve proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of the hBMSC.

TI Biocompatible glass-ceramic materials for bone substitution
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB A new bioactive glass composition (CEL2) in the SiO(2)-P(2)O(5)-CaO-MgO-K(2)O-Na(2)O system was tailored to control pH variations due to ion leaching phenomena when the glass is in contact with physiological fluids. CEL2 was prepared by a traditional melting-quenching process obtaining slices that were heat-treated to obtain a glass-ceramic material (CEL2GC) that was characterized thorough SEM analysis. Pre-treatment of CEL2GC with SBF was found to enhance its biocompatibility, as assessed by in vitro tests. CEL2 powder was then used to synthesize macroporous glass-ceramic scaffolds. To this end, CEL2 powders were mixed with polyethylene particles within the 300-600 mu m size-range and then pressed to obtain crack-free compacted powders (green). This was heat-treated to remove the organic phase and to sinter the inorganic phase, leaving a porous structure. The biomaterial thus obtained was characterized by X-ray diffraction, SEM equipped with EDS, density measurement, image analysis, mechanical testing and in vitro evaluation, and found to be a glass-ceramic macroporous scaffold with uniformly distributed and highly interconnected porosity. The extent and size-range of the porosity can be tailored by varying the amount and size of the polyethylene particles.

AB DNAzymes are oligonucleotides capable of specific catalysis of target mRNA. To date, a delivery vehicle for DNAzymes has not been developed. Chitosan is a biomaterial obtained abundantly in nature. A biocompatible c-jun (an oncogene) DNAzyme nanoparticle formulated from chitosan was found to be more active against osteosarcoma (bone cancer) cells, inducing apoptotic cell death in these cells. The formulation was stable in serum for a week and at room temperature for a month. Clinically, knockdown of c-jun gene expression with chitosan nanobiotechnology may improve treatment outcome for tumours growing in bone.

TI Nanostructural organization of naturally occurring composites - Part II:
   Silica-chitin-based biocomposites
SO JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS
AB Investigations of the micro- and nanostructures and chemical composition of the sponge skeletons as examples for natural structural biocomposites are of fundamental scientific relevance. Recently, we show that some demosponges (Verongula gigantea, Aplysina sp.) and glass sponges (Farrea occa, Euplectella aspergillum) possess chitin as a component of their skeletons. The main practical approach we used for chitin isolation was based on alkali treatment of corresponding external layers of spicules sponge material with the aim of obtaining alkali-resistant compounds for detailed analysis. Here, we present a detailed study of the structural and physicochemical properties of spicules of the glass sponge Rossella fibulata. The structural similarity of chitin derived from this sponge to invertebrate alpha chitin has been confirmed by us unambiguously using physicochemical and biochemical methods. This is the first report of a silica-chitin composite biomaterial found in Rossella species. Finally, the present work includes a discussion related to strategies for the practical application of silica-chitin-based composites as biomaterials. Copyright (C) 2008 Hermann Ehrlich et al.

TI Functionalization of polymer surface for nerve repair
SO JOURNAL OF PHOTOPOLYMER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Surfaces play an important role in biological system for most biological reactions occurring at surfaces and interfaces. One of the emphasis of developing biomaterials for nerve repair is to create perfect surfaces which can provoke specific cellular responses and direct new nerve tissue regeneration. The improvement in biocompatibility of biomaterials for nerve repair by directed surface functionalization is an important contribution to biomaterial development. In this paper, recent advance in polymer surface functionalization for nerve repair is reviewed. Various methods for polymer surface functionalization are introduced for developing nerve repair biomaterials, such as plasma treatment, ion implantation, hydroxyapatite coating, incorporation of bioactive molecules, micropatterning of surface, and their combinations.

AB New clinical and basic science data on the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which wear particles stimulate the host inflammatory response have provided deeper insight into the pathophysiology of periprosthetic bone loss. Interactions among wear particles, macrophages, osteoblasts, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and T cells contribute to the production of pro-inflammatory and proosteoclastogenic cytokines such as TNF-alpha, RANKL, M-SCF, PGE(2), IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8. These cytokines not only promote osteoclastogenesis but interfere with osteogenesis led by osteoprogenitor cells. Recent studies indicate that genetic variations in TNF-alpha, IL-1, and FRZB can result in subtle changes in gene function, giving rise to altered susceptibility or severity for periprosthetic inflammation and bone loss. Continuing research on the biologic effects and mechanisms of action of wear particles will provide a rational basis for the development of novel and effective ways of diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of periprosthetic inflammatory bone loss.

SO JOURNAL OF THE CERAMIC SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB In this study, hydroxyapatite-coated biopolymer nanofibrous membrane was synthesized by mineralizing the electrospun polycaprolactone nanofiber. The effect of the hydroxyapatite-coated nanofibrous membrane was mainly investigated on the proliferation and differentiation of human periodontal ligament fibroblast, which is necessary for periodontal tissue regeneration. Scanning electron microscopy revealed favorable cell attachment and spreading appearance on 1 d and MTS assay showed increased cell proliferation on the hydroxyapatite-coated nanofiber membrane during 14 d. From 7 to 14 d, alkaline phosphatase activity of the hydroxyapatite-coated nanofiber was significantly increased when compared to that of control group. Hydroxyapatite-coated nanofibrous membrane showed prominent mineral formation on day 14. As a result, it was clarified that the developed hydroxyapatite-coated nanofibrous membrane had favorable effects on the proliferation and differentiation of human periodontal ligament fibroblast and might be a good candidate material for periodontal tissue regeneration.

SO JOURNAL OF THE CERAMIC SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB The crystallographic orientation relationship between hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanocrystals and poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) graftpolymer-modified poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrate was studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We observed the microstructure of fabricated rod-like HAp nanocrystals and the interface of HAp/PET composite where, the HAp nanocrystals are bonded onto PAA graftpolymer-modified PET substrate. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of interface of the HAp/PET composite indicated! that some low index planes in HAp prism plane tended to be contact plane with the PET substrate surface. In particular, the {11 (2) over bar0} plane was distinctly found as the contact plane with PET substrate. In this material, it has been reported that the carboxyl groups of PAA graft-polymer are ionically-bonded with Ca ions on surface of the HAp nanocrystal. It was suggested that the periodic ionic arrangements of the {11 (2) over bar0} plane play an important role on the bonding between the HAp nanocrystals and the carboxyl groups of graft-polymer on the PET substrate.

TI Microfabricated implants for applications in therapeutic delivery,

SO LAB ON A CHIP
AB By adapting microfabrication techniques originally developed in the microelectronics industry novel devices for drug delivery, tissue engineering and biosensing have been engineered for in vivo use. Implant microfabrication uses a broad range of techniques including photolithography, and micromachining to create devices with features ranging from 0.1 to hundreds of microns with high aspect ratios and precise features. Microfabrication offers device feature scale that is relevant to the tissues and cells to which they are applied, as well as offering ease of en masse fabrication, small device size, and facile incorporation of integrated circuit technology. Utilizing these methods, drug delivery applications have been developed for in vivo use through many delivery routes including intravenous, oral, and transdermal. Additionally, novel microfabricated tissue engineering approaches propose therapies for the cardiovascular, orthopedic, and ocular systems, among others. Biosensing devices have been designed to detect a variety of analytes and conditions in vivo through both enzymatic-electrochemical reactions and sensor displacement through mechanical loading. Overall, the impact of microfabricated devices has had an impact over a broad range of therapies and tissues. This review addresses many of these devices and highlights their fabrication as well as discusses materials relevant to microfabrication techniques.

The frequently encountered defects of the SLM metal alloy parts such as non-fully melting, thermal deformation and balling were analyzed theoretically and experimentally, and the microstructure of the parts was analyzed on microscope. The results show that an appropriate selection of laser mode and scanning strategy assures a satisfying quality of the final parts; they also reveal that the SLM technology can be expected as a potential technology to directly manufacture the artificial implant of NiTi alloys.

AB Sufficient lighting is sometimes required when surgeons watch the mediastinum through the 7x7cm thoracic window in video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lobectomy. It is thus important to develop the "ultimately localized solid-state-lighting" because the distance between the window and the surface of the lung is as short as 4-5 cm. Our new idea was to place the module composed of red, green and blue light emitting diodes (RGB LEDs) at the tip of the retractor. Compared to a conventional endoscopic lighting consisting of halogen lamp, this method has lead to the bright and shadowless illumination within the entire thoracic cavity since the white RGB LEDs are emitted unidirectionally from the cylinder-shaped camera component, moving the shadows from the surgical instruments to the side of the incision. It also should be noted that we found an effective principle for controlling the color rendering of each biomaterial through the synthesis of LED lighting spectra, by which the visual performance of surgeons can be coordinated. Therefore, we believe that "medical RGB LEDs" will contribute to the safe operation, and will be developed to a standard lighting system in clinical settings with bright surgical fields in the near future.

AB This work is a review of the results of biomedical studies of polymer devices (films, fibers, microparticles, 3D implants) made from resorbable PHAs synthesized by the bacterium Wautersia (Ralstonia) eutropha B5786, using the technology developed at the institute of Biophysics of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Two types of PHAs - polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and a hydroxybutyrate/hydroxyvalerate copolymer (PHB/PHV) - have been proven to be biocompatible in vitro in cultures of fibroblasts, endothelial cells, hepatocytes, and osteoblasts, and in short- and long-duration experiments on animals. Polymer films and membranes have been found to be usable as scaffolds for functioning cells and monofilament suture fibers-for stitching muscular-fascial wounds and in abdominal surgery. Ectopic bone formation assay and experiments with the model of segmental osteotomy showed that 3D PHB and PHB/HA implants can be used for reparative osteogenesis.

AB For any biomaterial placed into a biological medium, the surface properties of the material, such as porosity, crystallinity, presence and distribution of electrical charge and functional groups are very critical parameters that determine the acceptance or rejection of the material. Applications, especially tissue engineering require some surface modifications at the molecular level without disturbing the bulk properties of the implants in order to enhance the cell attachment on the material. An appropriate technique is the application of glow discharge plasma which employs no solvents, takes place at ambient temperatures, and alterations take place only at the surface by changing the surface chemistry along with surface free energy (SFE) and efficiency for cell-material interaction. In this study, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film surfaces were modified with oxygen plasma. SFE and its dispersive and polar (acidic-basic) components of the modified surfaces were calculated by means of several theoretical approaches including geometric mean, harmonic mean and acid-base equations. The relation between SFE and its dispersive and polar components and cell attachment on surfaces were studied. The highest 3T3 cell attachment was obtained for the surface with the total SFE of 61.77 mJ/m(2) and polar component of 50.91 mJ/m(2) according to Geometric mean. The total SFE of this surface was calculated to be 61.06 mJ/m(2) and the polar component as 40.96 mJ/m(2) using the Harmonic mean method.

AB Silated hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (Si-HPMC) is a modified biopolymer used in biomaterial's domain. A hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) was functionalised with silane groups. The macromolecular solution of Si-HPMC (pH 12.9) generates an elastic state at physiological pH (similar to 7.4). in this work we present the gel formation of Si-HPMC resulting from the condensation of silanol groups. The crosslinked hydrogel was characterized using rheological techniques. With the scalar percolation model the gelation time was determined as a function of Si-HPMC concentration at 37 degrees C.

AB A new phosphorylated derivative of carboxymethylcellulose and amidic carboxymethylcellulose containing one phosphate group for each disaccharide unit was synthesized using sodium trimetaphospahte (STMP) as the phosphating agent. The new polysaccharide was characterized by infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and the amount of phosphate groups was determined by elemental analysis. These modified polysaccharides were used both to prepare 3D scaffolds and functionalize titanium oxide surfaces with the aim to improve the osseointegration with the host tissue. The presence of phosphate groups modify the physical-chemical properties of the hydrogels with respect to the native ones. The evaluation of the bioactivity of the phosphorylated carboxymethylcellulose hydrogels towards osteoblast-like cells showed a significant increase in the osteocalcin production. The modified surfaces were chemically characterized by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and FT-IR, whereas the surface topography was analysed by Atomic Force Measurements (AFM) measurements before and after the polysaccharide coating. In vitro biological tests using osteoblast-like cells demonstrated that phosphorylated carboxymethylcellulose functionalized TiO2 surfaces promoted better cell adhesion and significantly enhanced their proliferation. These findings suggest that the phosphate polysaccharide both as a 3D scaffold and as a surface coating promotes osteoblast growth potentially improving the biomaterial osseointegration rate.

AB We have developed a self-reticulating polymer based on silanized hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (Si-HPMC). The aim of this study was to determine whether this Si-HPMC hydrogel with or without calcium phosphate granules could represent a potential scaffold for bone tissue engineering.
   This study showed that Si-HPMC hydrogel didn't affect SaOS-2 and rat bone marrow cells viability. in addition, SaOS-2 cells are able to proliferate within Si-HPMC hydrogel containing or not calcium phosphate granules whereas Rat bone marrow cells proliferate only at the surface of calcium phosphate granules contained within Si-HPMC hydrogel. Finally, SaOS-2 cells seeded at the surface of reticulated Si-HPMC were not able to penetrate the hydrogel, while J774, a macrophage cells line, were able to move into the Si-HPMC hydrogel. These data indicate that Si-HPMC is a promissing scaffold for tissue engineering.

AB Magnesium alloy is a potential implant material due toits high load bearing, good biocompatibility and biodegradable properties. But the use as a biomaterial is limited due to its poor corrosion resistance. In this paper, hydroxyapatite (HAP) coating was fabricated on magnesium alloy substrate by cathodic electro-deposition method to improve the corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. XRD, EDS and SEM were used to investigate the structure, composition and morphology of the coating. The result showed that the post-treated coating was composed of needle-like hydroxyapatite, containing Na, Mg, C, Ca, P elements, and can be called chemically similar to bone. The biocompatibility of the coating was investigated by in vitro test. There were obvious Ca-P-Mg depositions on the coating, which can inhibit the further corrosion of magnesium alloy. From the results of this study, there is a strong rationale that needle-like HAP can be coated on magnesium and it can improve the biocompatibility of magnesium alloy effectively.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING C-BIOMIMETIC AND SUPRAMOLECULAR SYSTEMS
AB A Tris-HCl-buffered synthetic body fluid (SBF) solution, mimicking the human blood plasma, with the following ion concentrations of 27 mM HCO3- 2.5 mM Ca2+, 1.0 mM HPO42-, 142 mM Na+, 125 mM Cl-, 5 mM K+, 1.5 mM Mg2+ and 0.5 mM SO42- was used as an aqueous medium to process a number of bone substitute materials under the so-called biomimetic conditions of 37 degrees C and pH 7.4. This solution was named as Tris-SBF-27 mM. Firstly, collagen sponges were soaked in Tris-SBF-27 mM solution at 37 degrees C and were found to be fully covered with nanoporous apatitic calcium phosphate (Ap-CaP). The composites of collagen-Ap-CaP biomaterials are expected to be used in orthopedic and dental surgery. Secondly, Ap-CaP short whiskers or microrods with a novel nanotexture and surface areas higher than 45 m(2)/g were synthesized in Tris-SBF-27 mM solution. Thirdly, calcium sulfate cements doped with CaHPO4 (monetite), were shown to have apatite-inducing ability upon ageing in Tris-SBF-27 mM. CaHPO4 addition in calcium sulfate was found to improve its mechanical strength, measured after cement setting reaction. Pure calcium sulfate cement pellets were not stable in Tris-SBF-27 mM solutions and crumbled into a powder. All the samples were characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR, surface area and mechanical strength measurements. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) based polyurethane (PU) solution was prepared and then the PU solution was modified with N-isopropyl acrylamide by UV radiation without degassing to get thermo-sensitive membrane (PUNIPAAm). Then chitosan was impregnated onto the PUNIPAAm surface and treated by freeze-drying to get chitosan containing PUNIPAAm (PUNIPAAm-chi). Wettability on the various membranes was determined. The measurement of water vapor transmission rate on membranes and the antibacterial assessment were also evaluated. In order to evaluate the biocompatibility of these membranes, a cytotoxicity test and cell adhesion and proliferation assay were conducted in cell culture. The results showed that these thermo-sensitive PUNIPAAm membranes exhibited very low cytotoxicity and could support cell adhesion and growth. As having the antibacterial ability and the values of WVTR, permeance and permeability of the various PUNIPAAm-chi membranes are comparable to the commercial products, the PUNIPAAm-chi may be considered for wound dressing.

TI Wear and mechanical properties, and cell viability of gas-nitrided
   beta-type Ti-Nb-Ta-Zr system alloy for biomedical applications
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB Frictional wear resistance is one of the important properties of metallic biomaterials. Surface hardening treatments such as oxidizing, nitriding and ion implantation tend to be applied for improving the wear resistance of titanium and its alloys. The simple gas nitriding process is expected to further improve the wear resistance of newly developed beta-type Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr alloy (TNTZ) for biomedical applications. However, there is a possibility for the mechanical properties such as tensile and fatigue strength of TNTZ to be degraded through gas nitriding process. Therefore, the gas nitriding process was carried out in this study to improve the wear resistance of TNTZ and alpha+beta-type Ti-6Al-4V ELI alloy (Ti64), which is one of the representative titanium alloys practically applied for biomedical applications, in simulated body fluid (Ringer's solution). Their tensile and fatigue properties and cell viability was also investigated in order to confirm the reliability as biomedical materials.
   The Vickers hardness near the specimen surface of nitrided TNTZ and Ti64, where TiN and Ti2N forms. increases significantly as compared to that of their matrices. The wear resistances of TNTZ and Ti64 are improved significantly in Ringer's solution by nitriding process as compared to those of as-solutionized TNTZ (TNTZ(ST)) and Ti64 (Ti64(ST)). The tensile strength of nitrided TNTZ increases by around 90 MPa as compared to that of TNTZST. The tensile strength of nitrided Ti64 does not change significantly at all nitriding temperatures. On the other hand, the elongation decreases with increasing the nitriding temperature. The run out (plain fatigue limit) of TNTZ subjected to a nitriding process at 1123 K, which has relatively good balance between wear resistance and tensile properties, is around 300 MPa, and is nearly equal to that of Ti64 subjected to a nitriding process at 1123 K, although the tensile strength of the nitrided TNTZ is around 200 MPa smaller than that of the nitrided Ti64. The cell viabilities of nitrided TNTZ and Ti64 range from 1.4 to 1.6 against that of control (cell disc), and are a little higher than that of TNTZ(ST) and Ti64(ST). The cell viabilities of nitrided TNTZ and Ti64 after removing the oxide layer on their surfaces are similar to that of control and are not significantly degraded.

SP ASM Int, Mat Informat Soc
AB The use of titanium for medical and dental prostheses began with commercially pure titanium (CP Ti) some 15 years ago. Depending on applications, however, stronger alloys are demanded. Thus, a well accepted, industrial titanium alloy, Ti-6Al-4V, has been widely tested and used for various biomedical applications. On the other hand, the use of V as a biomaterial has been questioned from the standpoint of biocompatibility. Although an alternative alloy, Ti-6Al-7Nb, was introduced, a more economical alloy would be preferable. Therefore, we evaluated the Ti-Al + Cu alloy system by using Cu in the place of V in Ti-6Al-4V. Four experimental alloys, one binary Ti-5% (mass) Al and three ternary Ti-5%Al alloys with 1, 3 and 5% Cu were prepared by melting high-purity Al and Cu together with a Ti sponge in an argon-arc melting furnace. Specimens were made by casting these alloys and commercial Ti-6Al-4V into MgO-based investment molds in a centrifugal casting machine. The yield and tensile strengths and the percent elongation of the Ti-5Al-5Cu were found to be comparable to those of the Ti-6Al-4V (p > 0.05). The strength was increased by increasing Cu contents along with the reduction in elongation. The anodic polarization results in an artificial saliva revealed that all metals tested completely passivated in the normal intnaoral potential range (-58 to 212 mV). The grindability of Ti-5Al-5Cu, tested using a SiC wheel, was statistically better than that of Ti-6Al-4V and the other tested alloys (p < 0.01). The wear resistance of the Ti-5Al-5Cu, tested in an equipment that simulated chewing action, was statistically better than that of the Ti-6Al-4V (p < 0.01). With further refinements, the Ti-Al-Cu alloy could be a good candidate for some dental applications.

SO METALURGIA INTERNATIONAL
AB Recently, titanium is the most use metal for manufacturing dental implants. In the last decade, new titanium alloys have been developed in different areas of dentistry. Concurrently, oral treatments using gels containing fluoride have also been widely used in odontology. The aim of this study is to investigate the electrochemical behavior of a new titanium alloy containing Ta, in four different media based on the artificial saliva having different fluoride ions and lactic acid contents, and compare it with the behaviour of Ti6Al7Nb alloy used frequently as biomaterial. To investigate the electrochemical behavior of two titanium alloys the open circuit potential recording and linear sweep voltametric analysis were used. Our results have shown that Ti20Ta alloy have corresion resistance as good as that of Ti6Al7Nb in artifical saliva (pH = 8.0), acidified saliva (9.8 g/l lactic acid, pH = 2.5) and fluoridated saliva (1.0 g/l F; pH = 8.0). The corrosion of Ti6Al7Nb and Ti30Ta alloys is enhanced in fluoridated acidified saliva (9.8 g/l lactic acid, 1.0 g/l F, pH = 2.5).

AB Terahertz biosensors are used for sensing chemical and biochemical material. In order to sense small material quantities, such as DNA strands, sensors with a high sensitivity are needed. Our recent approach applies asymmetric double-split ring resonators (aDSR) in a two-dimensional array. Interaction of resonances within the structure results in a steep flank in the frequency response which is sensitively shifted by small amounts of biomolecules loaded on the sensor surface. Additionally a high E-field concentration connected to the split ring resonances is used to maximize the frequency shift induced by biomaterial covering only a small fraction of the sensor area. Minutes amounts of biomaterial can therefore be detected. In this presentation, the approach is analyzed with numerical simulation. We demonstrate the functionality and optimization of the aDSR array structures, and the capability to detect submicrometer layers of dielectric material with a spatially selective deposition on the resonant structures. A measurement of the complementary structure is presented as proof of principle.

TI THE POROACCESSIBILITY PARAMETERS FOR THREE-DIMENSIONAL CHARACTERIZATION
   OF ORTHOPAEDIC IMPLANTS POROUS COATINGS
SO METROLOGY AND MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS
AB The ability of formation of the proper bone-porous implant fixation depends, among others, on the structural-osteoinductive properties of the porous coating covering the orthopaedic implant surface. These properties, describing the poroaccessibility of porous biomaterial, are one of co-factors conditioning the promotion of bone tissue ingrowth into pore space of implant porous coating. So far the structural-osteoinductive properties of implants porous coatings are described by the traditional two-dimensional roughness parameters obtained with contact or non-contact roughness profile measurement (mostly standard surface roughness amplitude parameters e.g.: R(a), R(q), R(max)) or with the average pore size, which is, in the authors opinion, inadequate and unsatisfactory for porous coating characterization in respect of its poroaccessibility. The lack of proper directives on porous structure characterization of titanium and hydroxyapatite coatings on orthopaedic implants is the reason to work them out. In connection with the development of methods for surface texture analysis in three dimensions, the authors have perceived new possibilities for porous coatings microstructure analysis and on this base a set of parameters of poroaccessibility of implant porous coating for bone tissue ingrowth has been proposed: the effective volumetric porosity phi(Vef), the index of the porous coating space capacity V(PM), the representative surface porosity phi(Srep), the representative pore size P(Srep), the representative angle of the poroaccessibility Omega(rep) and the bone-implant interface adhesive surface enlargement index psi. With this set of parameters one can characterize the structural-osteoinductive properties of porous biomaterial. In this paper a new set of poroaccessibility parameters of implant porous coatings and a method of calculation of these parameters on the basis of three-dimensional roughness measurements are presented.

AB Photonic crystals are fabricated on plastic surfaces, producing narrow bandwidth resonances at any desired wavelength. While shifts in the resonant wavelength quantify the density of adsorbed biomaterial, the resonances also enhance the output of adsorbed fluorophores. The combined attributes of photonic crystals enable highly sensitive label-free detection and greatly amplified sensitivity of any fluorescence-based assay for applications in life science research, drug discovery, and environmental pathogen detection. Applications for label-free selective detection of viral pathogens with sensitivity of similar to 30 focal forming units, and detection of spore pathogens with single-unit resolution are highlighted. Amplified fluorescence, meanwhile, enables gene expression detection of DNA at concentrations similar to 2 orders of magnitude lower than detection on optically passive surfaces.

AB In this study we have combined fluorescence- and reflection-confocal laser scanning microscopy for the simultaneous visualization of living cells and surface topography beneath them. To this purpose we have designed a specific flow chamber and we have tested it with osteoblasts grown on an opaque, thick support, made of smooth or sandblasted titanium. Cells were loaded with Calcein-AM or tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), two probes employed as indicators of cell viability/morphology and mitochondrial membrane potential, respectively. Besides the acquisition of stacks of confocal sections, the system allowed also vertical views and faithful three-dimensional reconstruction of the samples.

In the middle of the 1990s strong interest was evoked, but then stagnation took place because the results obtained at that stage did not reach the contrast and the resolution achieved by conventional electron microscopy.
   To date, there exist only a few (similar to 12) publications on electron holography of biological objects, thus this topic is quite small and concise. The reason for this could be that holography is mostly established in materials science by physicists. Therefore, applications for off-axis holography were powerfully pushed forward in the area of imaging, e.g. electric or magnetic micro- and nanofields. Unstained biological systems investigated by means of off-axis electron holography up to now are ferritin, tobacco mosaic virus, a bacterial flagellum, T5 bacteriophage Virus, hexagonal packed intermediate layer of bacteria and the Semliki Forest virus. New results of the authors on collagen fibres and surface layer of bacteria, the so-called S-layer 2D crystal lattice are presented in this review. For the sake of completeness, we will shortly discuss in-line holography of biological samples and off-axis holography of materials related to biological systems, such as biomaterial composites or magnetotactic bacteria.

AB Reinforcement corrosion and crack formation are the major causes of limiting the durability or lifetime of concrete structures. A variety of additives or replacements of cement can be applied in order to improve the durability of the concrete. Cracking causes early deterioration of concrete what can be minimized by microbial - induced sealing or plugging of the cracks. This study was designed to describe the impact of a novel microbial protein on strength and microstructure characteristics of cement paste and mortar. The results presented in this article suggest that the novel microbial protein isolated from a Hot spring bacterium can be effective to increase the compressive strength and other physical properties of the cement paste and mortar. Microstructure analysis by ESEM and EDX show more hydration of the cement particles and increase of the calcium/silicon ratio of the CSH gel within the matrix in presence of the protein. The observed changes in micro-structural characteristics of the protein-amended cement paste, particularly with respect to increased uniformity of the matrix components, is reflected by strength improvement. This protein-amended cement-based biomaterial may be used for increasing durability and crack healing of concrete constructions in the future.

AB This paper will address key issues related to the synthesis, characterization and utilization of inorganic/organic hybrid coatings on TiAlVZr bioalloy to control adsorption at interface and the integration capacity of the implant. To enhance the integration capacity function of the biomaterial is necessary to control the composition and structure via the use of hybrid materials consisting of organic and inorganic biomimetic phases [1,2]. Such composite coatings mimic the structure of natural materials of tissues, in our case hydroxyapatite (HA) by association of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with calcium phosphates matrices. Calcium phosphate coating have been deposited on metal substrates by electrochemical method.

TI The materials science of bone: Lessons from nature for biomimetic
   materials synthesis
SO MRS BULLETIN
AB There has been considerable recent interest in natural bone as a material, due in part to its interesting combination of mechanical properties: bone is stiff and tough but lightweight. This unusual combination of properties results from a nanocomposite structure of approximately equal volumes of mineral and hydrated organic matter. Much recent effort has been focused on the structure, properties, and performance at different length scales relative to the hierarchical organization of bone. Historically, such bone research has emphasized clinical and medical aspects, including engineering materials for bone augmentation or replacement, bone-biomaterial interactions and interfaces, and more recently, scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. However, within the fast-growing biomimetics field, the bone extracellular matrix is taken as a model for materials development. Efforts have been made both to mimic the bony material itself as well as to mimic the process by which bone forms.

AB Experimental results showed that both of commercial pure titanium (CP-Ti) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) intermediate layers significantly enhanced the bonding strength of HACs (one-way ANOVA test, p 0.05). On the basis of fracture morphologies and bonding strength data fluctuation, the Weibull model provided a powerful statistical analysis for assessing the failure mechanism and the reliability of composite coatings. Plasma-sprayed HACs were reliable materials with a right shift wear-out failure model (m > 3) of increasing failure rate (IFR). The HA composite coatings remained in tack on the substrate, which represented better reliability and less dissociation for further applications. The measured bonding strength of HACs was a combination of adhesive and cohesive strength of a coating layer. The area fraction of adhesive failure tended to decrease with introducing the reinforced intermediate layer, especially for the HA/YSZ composite coating. The decrease of adhesive failure area fraction represented good interlocking between the coating/substrate interfaces. The knowledge of fracture behaviour in HACs with reinforced intermediate layers will be very helpful for the understanding and prediction of the bonding strength.

AB Magnesium has been proposed as an implant metal due to its low weight and inherent biocompatibility. However, it use as a biomaterial is seriously limited by its poor corrosion n resistance. Die-cast AZ91D and rolled AZ31B alloys, which are commercial magnesium alloys, were used in this study. After plasma anodization, SEM showed that the surface had a relatively high porosity with some micro-cracks. EDX revealed Mg, Al and Zn on the surface of the samples before anodization. After anodization, there was an increase in the oxygen EDX peak intensity with a concomitant decrease in the magnesium intensity. Anodized AZ91D had the best corrosion resistance according to the potentiodynamic polarization curves. After immersion in Hanks solution for 10 days, the untreated AZ31B sample had the highest pH value due to formation of OH- on the film surface.

AB Materials used to make artificial vessels and hearts can cause thrombosis, thus hindering the development of these therapeutic aids. Endothelial cells (ECs) play a key role in thrombosis, so in this study, we used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and tested the hemocompatibility of different biomaterials. We then measured the signal proteins MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and Nuclear Factor- kB (NF-kappa B) to investigate the correlation between their expression and the degree of hemocompatibility. The results showed that ECs in the polyurethane (PU-60) group had significantly more NF-kappa B than the negative control (P<0.5), To identify whether the increased expression of NF-kappa B was induced by MAPK activation, we investigated changes in phosphorylated MAPK. We found both MAPK and NF-kappa B are ideal indicators for evaluating the hemocompatibility of biomaterial.

AB By mimicking the microstructure of human cortical bone, a variety of bioactive particle reinforced polymer composites have been developed for hard tissue repair. Apart from biological assessments, these composites must be fully evaluated in terms of their mechanical performance before they can be used in patients. The bioactive particles in these composites are normally hard (relative to matrix materials) and brittle bioceramics such as hydroxyapatite (HA), tricalcium phosphate (TCP), Bioglass (R), etc. The matrices can be either "biostable" polymers such as high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polysulfone (PSU) or biodegradable polymers such as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and poly(L-lactide) (PLLA). These polymers on their own possess different mechanical properties and display different deformation behaviours. With the incorporation of various amounts of particulate HA, TCP or Bioglass (R), the bone analogue polymeric composites exhibit a spectrum of deformation and fracture characteristics. In our systematic studies of HA/HDPE, Bioglass (R)/HDPE, HA/PSU, HA/PHB, TCP/PHB and a few other bone analogues biomaterials over the past fifteen years, mechanical tests were conducted under a variety of loading conditions (tension, compression, bending, torsion, etc.). Comparisons of deformation and fracture behaviours of these composites were made and presented. The insights that have been gained are important for developing other bioactive ceramic-polymer composites.

AB Various techniques have been developed to produce second generation biomaterials for tissue repair. These include extrusion, molding, salt leaching, spinning etc, but success in regenerating tissues has been limited. It is important to develop porous material, yet with a fibrous structure for it to be biomimetic. To mimic biological tissues, the extra-cellular matrix usually contains fibers in nano scale. To produce nanostructures, self-assembly or electrospinning can be used. Adding a drug release function to such a material may advance applications further for use in controlled tissue repair. This turns the resulting device into a multifunctional porous, fibrous structure to support cells and drug releasing properties in order to control tissue reactions. A bioabsorbable poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-D,L lactide) 95/5 (PCL) was made into diluted solution using a solvent, to which was added 2w-% of diclofenac sodium (DS). Nano-fibers were made by electrospinning onto substrate. Microstructure of the resulting nanomat was studied using SEM and drug release profiles with UV/VIS spectroscopy. Thickness of the electrospun nanomat was about 2 mm. SEM analysis showed that polymeric nano-fibers containing drug particles form a highly interconnected porous nano structure. Average diameter of the nano-fibers was 130nm. There was a high burst peak in drug release, which decreased to low levels after one day. The used polymer has slow a degradation rate and though the nanomat was highly porous with a large surface area, drug release rule is slow. It is feasible to develop a nano-fibrous porous structure of bioabsorbable polymer, which is loaded with test drug. Drug release is targeted at improving the properties of biomaterial for use in controlled tissue repair and regeneration.

AB Biopolymers have received much attention lately for use in electronic applications. Salmon DNA complexed with cetyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (DNA-CTMA) produces a material soluble in organic solvents, enhancing the ease of processing. DNA-CTMA has shown promise as an electron blocking layer in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and potential as a gate insulating material in field effect transistors (FETs). To realize an all bio-based FET, we are continuing to investigate the use of DNA as the semiconducting layer. In addition to tailoring the properties of the biomaterial to increase the conductivity, we are also trying to better characterize these materials and explore different deposition techniques. Inkjet printing offers an unique ability to reproducibly deposit materials in a spatially controlled fashion, using picoliter amounts with high throughput. This paper will present how parameters such as solvent evaporation rate and substrate influence film properties. The characterization of the resulting DNA films includes atomic force microscopy (AFM) and white light interferometry.

Recently some studies of nanoindentation properties in insect were carried out. While the surface roughness of natural biomaterials problem should not to be ignored in nanoindentation testing. The surface roughness will critically affect the precision of result of nanoindentation testing and caused error data. In this paper, the biomaterials specimen preparation methods for nanoindentation testing will be reviewed.

TI Confocal Brillouin microscopy for three-dimensional mechanical imaging
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Acoustically induced inelastic light scattering, first reported in 1922 by Brillouin(1), allows non-contact, direct readout of the viscoelastic properties of a material and has widely been investigated for material characterization 2, structural monitoring 3 and environmental sensing'. Extending the Brillouin technique from point sampling spectroscopy to imaging modality(5) would open up new possibilities for mechanical imaging, but has been challenging because rapid spectrum acquisition is required. Here, we demonstrate a confocal Brillouin microscope based on a fully parallel spectrometer-a virtually imaged phased array-that improves the detection efficiency by nearly 100-fold over previous approaches. Using the system, we show the first cross-sectional Brillouin imaging based on elastic properties as the contrast mechanism and monitor fast dynamic changes in elastic modulus during polymer crosslinking. Furthermore, we report the first in situ biomechanical measurement of the crystalline lens in a mouse eye. These results suggest multiple applications of Brillouin microscopy in biomedical and biomaterial science.

AB Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine has emerged as an innovative scientific field that focuses on development of new approaches for repairing cells, tissues and organs. While the current paradigm of utilizing combinations of biomaterial scaffolds and cells for tissue construction has shown to be effective, only a limited number of these technologies have been successfully translated to patients. This is due to various issues that are encountered in the tissue building process. Recent development of novel biomaterials, the discovery of new sources of cells, and advances in scaffold fabrication strategies are being applied to address these challenges. One of the challenges that hinder clinical translation is the inefficiency of current cell delivery methods. Living tissues maintain inherent multi-cellular heterogeneous structures, and rebuilding of such complex structures requires subtle arrangements of different cell types and extracellular matrix components at specific anatomical target sites. Inkjet printing technology has been proposed as a tool to address cell delivery concerns. In this session, this versatile method of building complex tissue structures will be discussed.

AB We give four case studies showing how Atomic Force Microscopy is used in the pharmaceutical industry and in medical research. We look at structures on length scales from I nm to many pm. Lactose is perfectly stable until you look closely. Molecules diffuse on particle surfaces over time in response to temperature and humidity, causing unanticipated physical changes in bulk materials. Polymer microspheres are not spherical at all. More importantly, the crystalline vs amorphous form of tiny particles on the microsphere surface can affect flowability. Collagen is a monodisperse polymer when first synthesized, but is crosslinked when incorporated into living tissue. When tissue is processed to make an injectable biomaterial, it is helpful to see and measure the now-complex molecular structure. In the hunt for the molecular basis of disease, clinical, cellular, and chemical studies are essential. AFM visualization of a key peptide-DNA complex completed the picture for psoriasis.

SO POLYMER-PLASTICS TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING
AB Composite biomaterial composed of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and hydroxyapatite (HA) was obtained by using the combination of solvent evaporation technique and hot pressing. HA particles in the PLLA matrix were homogeneously dispersed. A typical morphology of brittle failure with a smooth fracture surface was observed. The addition of HA particles changed significantly the appearance of the impact fracture surface to a pattern of multiple cracks. With the increasing of the amount of the HA, the bending strength of composite decreases while the bending modulus increases. The PLLA/HA composite exhibits improved cell compatibility due to the good biocompatibility of the HA particles.

TI Biomimetic modification of chitosan with covalently grafted lactose and
   blended heparin for improvement of in vitro cellular interaction
SO POLYMERS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES
AB Lactose- and heparin-modified chitosan films were prepared and their physical and biological properties were compared with chitosan, chitosan-g-heparin, and chitosan-g-lactose films. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement showed that all these films in the dry state were rather flat with a roughness smaller than 20 nm. While the chitosan-g-lactose/heparin and chitosan-g-lactose films have the highest swelling and weight loss ratios, the chitosan and chitosan-g-heparin films have the lowest. The chitosan-g-lactose/heparin film showed stronger ability to induce chondrocyte attachment, proliferation, viability, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) secretion than that of the chitosan, chitosan-g-heparin, and chitosan-g-lactose films. Chondrocyte aggregates and nodules were observed on the chitosan-g-lactose/heparin and chitosan-g-lactose films, which still preserved viable metabolic ability. These results show that the lactose-modified and heparin-incorporated chitosan film can enhance the cell-biomaterial interaction synchronously. The resulting chitosan-g-lactose/heparin material is more bioactive that might be applicable as promising scaffold for chondrogenesis. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Tissue engineering and advanced medical technologies have the potential to dramatically improve the quality of human life. In order to move beyond empirical trial and error into design, biomaterials development is in urgent need of reliable measurement tools and techniques to engineer structures that meet specific physiological requirements for clinical use. This requires the development of design principles based on the physical understanding of how cells respond to molecular signals and integrate multiple inputs to generate a given biological response to their environment. Biomaterial scaffolds, for example, support cells, give tissues their form, and are an important source of information that drives cell fate. The definition and quantification of the type of relationships that trigger specific cell response to polymer composition and structure will enhance the rational design of tissue-engineered products. To meet this need, NIST is developing instruments, methodologies, and standards for the measurement of materials properties and cell response to properties on surfaces and in 3D scaffolds. Many tools and techniques were adapted (e.g., combinatorial libraries, biochemical assays, electron-, atomic force-, and fluorescence microscopy, etc.) to examine cell characteristics like adhesion, morphology, and migration as a function of the physical properties of biomaterials. This chapter introduces the characterization techniques and modeling tools used to obtain chemical, physical, and structural information that describe cell morphology and migration on different polymeric surfaces. The results identified key variables that impact the engineering and design of biomaterials.

AB The increased understanding of proteins and the human genome point towards a future in which selective proteins may replace synthetic drugs in the general cure of disease. In this scenario the ability of controlled and gentle release of proteins provide the key for successful treatment. To address the ability of full protein delivery we have developed a series of telechelic biodegradable ionomers based on poly (trimethylene carbonate) carrying zwitterionic, anionic or cationic functional groups. The introduction of polar end-groups provides a material with unique properties that directs the introduced functionality within the material bulk but also to the material surface if water is introduced. Bulk aggregation provide a low elastic modulus material and the ability to surface enrich provide the on-set of water swelling. The latter finally results in a co-continuous water-ionomer structure that engulfs and stores proteins simply by soaking the material in an aqueous protein solution. Following protein loading the material can be dried and re-immersed in water so that release occurs. Our results, including both the careful synthesis and the ability to load and release proteins, provides new possibilities for full protein delivery.
   In this chapter the increased understanding of the water swelling properties and the subsequent formation of bulk water domains in biodegradable poly (trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) ionomers is presented. The recent discovery that A functional PTMC may be functionalized with polar co-phosphoryl choline (PC) end groups and that the resulting telechelic zwitter ionomer forms an interesting low elastic modulus material has encouraged and directed the use of biodegradable ionomers in new areas of biomaterial research (I). Present findings now suggest that the scope of the synthesis may be broadened to provide telechelic ionomers with additional functionalities (2) and also that the water absorbing properties of such ionomers indicate their potential to serve as novel carriers for the loading and release of proteins (3).

AB The development of porous metals and coatings has revolutionized the field of orthopaedics. However, most implants are fabricated utilizing traditional materials (i.e. sintered beads, fiber metal, plasma spray), which have several inherent limitations. Several new porous metals have been recently introduced to improve upon the biomaterial properties of these traditional metals. Tritanium (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ), Regenerex (Biomet, Warsaw, IN), and Trabecular Metal (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN) are currently available for use in orthopaedic surgery, all with a characteristic appearance similar to cancellous bone. The open-cell structure of these materials affords several intriguing properties, including; high volumetric porosity (60-80%), low modulus of elasticity, and high frictional characteristics. The following represents a review of the biomaterial properties and applications in orthopaedic surgery for this new class of highly porous metals.

AB Porous Nitinol has been implanted with success as orthopaedic devices for bone attachment or replacement for over two decades. However, because of the presence of nickel in Nitinol, its use in biomaterial applications has been controversial due to the possible release of nickel (Ni) ions. The objective of the study was therefore to determine the effect of surface modification treatments in order to minimize the nickel ion release from porous Nitinol. Different treatments have been studied: annealing, TiN coating, TiO(2) coating, and pre-treatments in SBF solutions.
   The results show that surface modification treatments can have the most desirable effect on the release of nickel ions from porous nitinol. Compared to non-annealed porous Nitinol, annealing reduces the Ni leaching by a factor of 3, bringing the nickel lifetime release for an average size spinal implant to the same quantity of nickel absorbed in one day from a normal diet. Compared to non-annealed porous Nitinol, TiN coating reduces the Ni leaching by a factor of 10, TiO(2) coating by a factor of 14, and SBF pre-treatments by a factor of 12. The best results have been obtained by combining a TiN coating with the SBF pre-treatment: the release of Ni ions was 24 times lower than for the non-amlealed condition.

TI Early histological evaluation of bone defect healing with and without
   guided bone regeneration techniques: Experimental animal studies
SO POSTEPY HIGIENY I MEDYCYNY DOSWIADCZALNEJ
AB Introductions: To obtain osseous tissue regeneration, treatment methods referred to as guided bone regeneration are used which utilize the mechanical, chemical, and biological properties of materials.
   Material/Methods: Eighteen white rabbits were used. Under general anesthesia, a 5 mm in diameter defect was created transcutaneously in the femur trochanter major. The rabbits were divided into three groups depending on the type of the intraosseous defect (ID) treatment: in group I (C) the control IDs were left to heal spontaneously, in II (BOC+BG) the IDs were filled with Bio-Oss Collagen (R) and Bio Gide Perio (R) membrane, and in III (PRP) the IDs were filled with BOC (R) and platelet-rich plasma (Curasan Centrifuge (R)). The animals were sacrificed 1 and 3 months after the surgical procedure. The histological material was stained with hematoxylin and eosin and using the van Gieson method.
   Results and Conclusions: In the earlier histological examinations (1 and 3 months after the procedures), resorption of the biomaterial and the formation of new bone trabeculas were observed in both groups II and III. At the first observation the extent of biomaterial resorption and the intensity of the osteogenic process were greater in group III, but after 3 months group II had a slight advantage. Fragmented remnants of the biomaterial in both groups were surrounded by newly formed bone and locally by fibrous connective tissue. At both observation times the number of bone trabeculas after implantation in groups II and III was greater than in the control group.

AB Shear strain patterns in a cylindrical gelatin sample under transient angular acceleration were measured by tagged magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Measured strain fields were compared to theoretical strain fields obtained by finite element (FE) simulation. Agreement between theory and experiment is very good. The current results support the utility of the experimental approach for tasks such as measurement of shear waves in brain tissue during angular acceleration of the skull. The results also show that a simple viscoelastic model is suitable to describe rapid shear deformation of a gel biomaterial.

AB One approach to enhance nerve and spinal cord regeneration following injury is to implant a biomaterial scaffold to "bridge" the gap of the injury. Structural/mechanical anisotropy has been suggested as a means of orienting this growth axially. We have spatially varied the mechanical properties of a 3D collagen gel to direct growth axially and unidirectionally. Gradients of mechanical properties were generated in collagen gels by exposing the collagen to a 0-1mM gradient of genipin, a cell-tolerated crosslinking agent, for 12hrs via microfluidics. The gradient of stiffness was confirmed via a gradient of genipin-induced fluorescence intensity, which we have previously correlated to the storage modulus of collagen gels. The growth of neurites from isolated chick embryo dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in the presence of these gradients was evaluated after 5 days in culture. In control cases, neurites grew into the collagen gel and up either side of the cross-channel to approximately equal lengths. A 20% difference in differential growth was observed in control experiments. In contrast, when presented a gradient of shear modulus from similar to 365Pa - 60Pa, neurites elected to grow down the gradient of stiffness to the compliant side, with an almost 300% difference. Interestingly, the length of neurites in gels with gradients was significantly greater than the length of those grown in gels with uniform, untreated gels with high compliance. Control of neurite growth, cell migration, and other aspects of cell behavior in 3D scaffolds via mechanical properties offers vast potential for tissue engineering and other regenerative therapies.

AB In this work, the spreading properties of biomaterials, while a counter-rotating roller is used in rapid prototyping machines, are modeled and characterized. For modeling, the slab method is used in which biomaterial geometrical properties are incorporated into the model. A pressure dependent plasticity model is used as a constitutive model for biomaterial powders. In addition, the coulomb friction law for the powder-roller interface boundary is incorporated into the model. Size and shape of powder particles as well as roller rotational and linear velocities are considered within the friction coefficient.
   Powder bed parameters such as compaction pressure, stress distribution and relative density are predicted using the simulation.

AB Chitosan is a natural amino polysaccharide and has perfect biocompatibility and antibacterial function with broad-spectrum. Variational characteristics of glutinosity in chitosan/ acetic acid gel polymer blending with a certain concentration of polyvinylalcohol (PVA) in different condition were measured. Sericin is soluble polypeptide macromolecular compound dissolving in warm water, being high chemical characteristics, and having some kinds of necessary amino acids, high moisture permeability, high moisture retention and with better human affinity, people can use the mixture blending silk sericin with PVA and chitosan to manufacture valuable composite materials. In the experiment, the degradation of the mixture membrane in simulated body fluid (SBF) was measured. The results showed that the speed of degradation of the film can be adjusted by using different concentration of PVA and chitosan and/or sericin.

AB Despite millions of dollars and several decades of research targeted at their prevention and eradication, biofilm-associated infections remain the major cause of urological device failure. Numerous strategies have been aimed at improving device design, biomaterial composition, surface properties and drug delivery, but have been largely circumvented by microbes and their plethora of attachment, host evasion, antimicrobial resistance, and dissemination strategies. This is not entirely surprising since natural biofilm formation has been going on for millions of years and remains a major part of microorganism survival and evolution. Thus, the fact that biofilms develop on and in the biomaterials and tissues of humans is really an extension of this natural tendency and greatly explains why they are so difficult for us to combat. Firstly, biofilm structure and composition inherently provide a protective environment for microorganisms, shielding them from the shear stress of urine flow, immune cell attack and some antimicrobials. Secondly, many biofilm organisms enter a metabolically dormant state that renders them tolerant to those antibiotics and host factors able to penetrate the biofilm matrix. Lastly, the majority of organisms that cause biofilm-associated urinary tract infections originate from our own oral cavity, skin, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts and therefore have already adapted to many of our host defenses. Ultimately, while biofilms continue to hold an advantage with respect to recurrent infections and biomaterial usage within the urinary tract, significant progress has been made in understanding these dynamic microbial communities and novel approaches offer promise for their prevention and eradication. These include novel device designs, antimicrobials, anti-adhesive coatings, biodegradable polymers and biofilm-disrupting compounds and therapies.

AB Mesenchymal stem cells are multipotential cells capable of differentiating into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, tenocytes, and myoblasts. Wharton's jelly consists of stem cells that are a rich Source of primitive multipotent mesenchymal cells. Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) has been widely utilized as a biomaterial to promote new bone formation. We isolate and characterize umbilical cord Wharton's Jelly-derived mesenchymal stem (UCMS) cells derived from Wharton's jelly and examine the biological activity of DBM in this cell line. Osteoblast differentiation of the UCMS cells was determined using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay. To examine differential gene expression during osteogenic differentiation, total RNA was isolated from UCMS cells in the absence or presence of DBM on day7 and analyzed using osteogenesis cDNA gene array. The selected genes were verified using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses. Wharton's jelly derived cells could differentiate along ail osteogenic lineage after treatment of DBM The ALP activity assay showed that human UCMS cells Could differentiate into osteogenic lineage. Gene expression of human UCMS cells treated with DBM for 7 days was analyzed by using cDNA array and RT-PCR analyses. We round that expression of RUNX2 and SMAD2 was upregulated whereas SMAD7 expression was downregulated as confirmed by RT-PCR. UCMS cells from a Wharton's jelly of human Umbilical cord Could express osteogenesis genes for treatment with DBM. Wharton's jelly front Umbilical cord is a new Source of mesenchymal stem cells that are readily available for application to bone tissue engineering.

AB Zwitterionic copolymers were synthesised from N,N-dimethyl-N-(2-acryloylethyl)-N-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium betaine (SPDA) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) produce a series of polyzwitterion hydrogels. For the synthesis of the charge-balanced copolymer hydrogels, two cationic monomers were selected: 2-(diethylamino) ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and 3-(dimethylamino) propyl methacrylamide (DMAPMA), and an anionic monomer; 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulphonic acid (AMPS). Two series of charge-balanced copolymers were synthesized from stoichiometrically equivalent ratios of DMAEMA or DMAPMA and AMPS with HEMA as a termonomer. All synthesized copolymers produced clear and cohesive hydrogels. The zwitterionic and charge-balanced copolymers displayed similar equilibrium water contents together with similar mechanical and Surface energy properties. The swelling of the zwitterionic and the charge-balanced copolymers shows some features of antipolyelectrolyte behavior.

AB Corrosion resistance is one of the key requirements for a successful biomaterial. Nitinol is being considered for biomedical applications, where both the austenite and martensite phases are exposed to the biological environment throughout the service life of the device. Although the corrosion behavior of austenite has been well established, the corrosion of martensite has not been fully characterized. A detailed corrosion comparison between the different nitinol phases was conducted and the results were evaluated. The purpose of this study is to understand the electrochemical behavior of both phases of nitinol relating to the breakdown potential and repassivation tendencies.
   The material specimens were thermally treated to ensure that one was austenite, and the other was martensite at 22 degrees C. DSC, or differential scanning calorimetry confirmed the material phases of each sample. Cyclic potentiodynamic polarization measurements yield information on corrosion rates, passivation abilities, and pitting tendencies. Therefore, these curves were obtained for the austenite, stress-induced martensite, and thermally-induced martensite phases in Hank's simulated physiological solution. The breakdown potential was similar for the thermally-induced martensite and austenite phases with high noble potentials. While the stress-induced martensite had a lower breakdown. In addition, the stress-induced martensite phase produced a higher corrosion rate compared to the thermally-induced martensite and austenite phases. The corrosion performance observed was due to the changes in surface morphology where the stress initiated microdefects naturally lowered the corrosion rate.

AB Sol-gel derived silica and titania have a specific interaction with many biological molecules, microbes, algae, cells and living tissue. The specific interactions mean that they differ from common reactions between non-viable materials and biomolecules or living tissues and the interactions are mostly beneficial from the viewpoint of biotechnical applications. Pepetides and proteins may preserve their activity and bacteria, algae and cells may preserve their viability and viruses their infectivity as encapsulated in sol-gel derived silica. Silica and titania are known to form a direct bond with living tissue which can be utilized in the biomaterial applications. Other application areas of silica and titania are in biosensing, tissue engineering, gene therapy, controlled delivery of therapeutic agents and environmental protection.

AB The ability to harvest and culture stem cell populations from various human postnatal tissues is central to regenerative medicine applications, including tissue engineering. The discovery of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells within the stromal fraction of adipose tissue prompted their use for the healing and reconstruction of many tissues. Here, we examined the influence of adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) on skin's regenerative processes, from a tissue engineering perspective. Using a self-assembly approach, human skin substitutes were produced. They featured a stromal compartment containing human extracellular matrix endogenously produced from either dermal fibroblasts or adipose-derived stem/stromal cells differentiated or not toward the adipogenic lineage. Human keratinocytes were seeded on each stroma and cultured at the air-liquid interface to reconstruct a bilayered skin substitute. These new skin substitutes, containing an epidermis and a distinctive stroma devoid of synthetic biomaterial, displayed characteristics similar to human skin. The influence of the type of stromal compartment on epidermal morphogenesis was assessed by the evaluation of tissue histology, the expression of key protein markers of the epidermal differentiation program ( keratin [ K] 14, K10, transglutaminase), the expression of dermo-epidermal junction components (laminins, collagen VII), and the presence of basement membrane and hemidesmosomes. Our findings suggest that adipose-derived stem/stromal cells could usefully substitute dermal fibroblasts for skin reconstruction using the self-assembly method. Finally, by exploiting the adipogenic potential of ASCs, we also produced a more complete trilayered skin substitute consisting of the epidermis, the dermis, and the adipocyte-containing hypodermis, the skin's deepest layer.

AB As magnesium is an essential element for the human body, magnesium alloys are expected to be promising implant materials despite their lower corrosion resistance. The most potential advantages of magnesium lie on both excellent biocompatibility and good mechanical properties. A TiO2 coating had been successfully deposited on the surface of AM60 samples by using a thermal spray technique and was then sealed with sodium silicate. The corrosion behavior was investigated by using the potentiodynamic electrochemical technique. The experimental results demonstrated that the TiO2 coating had a porous ceramic structure. The thickness and micro hardness of the layer reached 40 mu m, and 886 HV, respectively. After additional sealing with sodium silicate, TiO2 coating on magnesium alloy improved corrosion resistance in Hank's solution.

TI Expression of CXC chemokines and their receptors is modulated during

SO TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A
AB Chemokines contribute to the maintenance of cartilage homeostasis. To evaluate the role of CXC chemokines CXCL8 (interleukin-8), CXCL10 (interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10), CXCL12 (stroma-derived factor-1) and CXCL13 (B-cell attracting chemokine-1) and their receptors, respectively CXCR1-2, CXCR3, CXCR4, and CXCR5, during chondrogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells (h-MSCs), we used a well-defined in vitro model. Chondrogenic differentiation was analyzed on h-MSCs grown on hyaluronic acid-based biomaterial in the presence or absence of transforming growth factor-beta, and the expression and modulation of CXC chemokines and receptors were evaluated at different time points. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze their expression at the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) level, and immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to evaluate their expression at the protein level. Human articular cartilage biopsies were used to evaluate chemokine and receptor expression in normal tissue. We found no expression of CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, or CXCL10 at the mRNA level. CXCL8 mRNA was down-modulated, whereas at the protein level, we found greater release of this chemokine. CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 were down-modulated during chondrogenesis. By contrast, CXCR5 was up-regulated, whereas its ligand CXCL13 was lower. These data were also confirmed on human articular cartilage. These findings show that, during in vitro h-MSC chondrogenic differentiation, chemokine and receptor expression was specifically induced or repressed. This was in line with what the authors also found in normal articular cartilage, suggesting a role in differentiation and maturation of a cartilage-like structure in vitro and consequently the regulation of cartilage homeostasis.

TI Biocompatibility: Meeting a Key Functional Requirement of Next-
   Generation Medical Devices
SO TOXICOLOGIC PATHOLOGY
AB The array of polymeric, biologic, metallic, and ceramic biomaterials will be reviewed with respect to their biocompatibility, which has traditionally been viewed as a requirement to develop a safe medical device. With the emergence of combination products, a paradigm shift is occurring that now requires biocompatibility to be designed into the device. In fact, next-generation medical devices will require enhanced biocompatibility by using, for example, pharmacological agents, bioactive coatings, nano-textures, or hybrid systems containing cells that control biologic interactions to have desirable biologic outcomes. The concept of biocompatibility is moving from a "do no harm" mission (i.e., nontoxic, nonantigenic, nonmutagenic, etc.) to one of doing "good," that is, encouraging positive healing responses. These new devices will promote the formation of normal healthy tissue as well as the integration of the device into adjacent tissue. In some contexts, biocompatibility can become a disruptive technology that can change therapeutic paradigms (e. g., drug-coated stents). New database tools to access biocompatibility data of the materials of construction in existing medical devices will facilitate the use of existing and new biomaterials for new medical device designs.

AB Micro/nanosizing effect of materials onto biological organism was investigated by both in vitro biochemical cell functional test and in vivo animal implantation test. Dependence of reaction of cells and tissue, and that of bone fori-nation of apatite on particle size were studied. The increase of specific surface area causes the enhancement of chemical reactivity and therefore toxicity in many cases, This is the most usually and easily recognizable and strongest effect in most cases. However there is the other effect which becomes prominent especially for biocompatible materials such as Ti and TiO(2). Stimulus was increased with the decrease of particle size and pronounced below 3 mu m by inducing phagocytosis to cells and inflammation to tissue. For the size below 50nm, particles invade into the internal body through the respiratory or digestive system and diffuse inside body. For bone, synthetic hydroxyapatite exhibits excellent osteoconductivity but it is not substituted with natural bone and remains permanently in the body, When the composite with collagen and nanoapatite synthesized in the biomimetic aspects is implanted, resorption of nanocomposite through phagocytosis by osteoclasts and new bone formation by osteoblasts occurred simultaneously after inflammation. Nanocomposite leads to the bone substitutional properties, which resembles the remodeling process in natural bone. Thus nanosizing induces the intrinsic functions of biological organism and results in the conversion of functions such as from biocompatibility to stimulus and from osteoconductivity but non-bone substitutional to bone substitutional properties through biological process.

AB To prepare the biomaterial surface having both lubricity and biocompatibility, we aimed to prove the mechanism of the resistance of friction and protein adsorption with grafting polymer. We prepared poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) grafted layer using an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method, which had the advantage of controlling surface structures oil nanoscale. From the results Of Surface characterization, it was confirmed that the thickness of the PMPC grafted layer was 4-10 nm and the conformation of the PMPC grafted layer was brushlike. We investigated the friction properties in air and in water with an atomic force microscopy (AFM). The friction coefficients of the PMPC brush layers were decreased dramatically in water and the resistance of friction depended on the thickness of the PMPC brush layer. We also investigated the protein adhesion properties by measuring the force-distance curves using the AFM cantilever immobilized with a bovine serum albumin (BSA). The adhesion force between the BSA and the PMPC brush layers were markedly reduced and the resistance of the BSA adhesion depended on the thickness of the PMPC brush layer. For resisting both friction and protein adsorption in water, it was a key factor to keep the thick hydrated layer made by the elongated hydrophilic PMPC brush chains.

TI Regeneration of the dog's axotomized sciatic nerve with preg
   nenolone-saturated chitosan prosthesis implanted through the
   tubulization technique
SO VETERINARIA MEXICO
AB Peripheral nerves can be injured by traumatisms or mechanical causes, and thermal, ischemic or tumoral damage, this could present inconveniences of the mobility, sensibility and loss of motor function at the denervated area. The surgical techniques applied to repair nerves have gone through several phases of evolution such as the tubulization technique which consists of a prosthesis with a pipe shape at the segment injured. In this work the biomaterial utilized to manufacture the prosthesis was chitosan, since this compound allows to incorporate to its matrix promoting nervous growing substances that are released in situ for a long time while being degraded by titular lysosomes of organic origin. It is known, by diverse studies, that several neurosteroids are involved during the regeneration process of peripheral nerves, which functions are already described, as pregnenolone. In order to determine if there was or not regeneration and the degree of maturity of this,12 young French Poodle female dogs of 1 to 1.5 years old were used (four were used as intact control group, four were subjected to tubulization technique with chitosan, and four went into tubulization technique with chitosan and pregnenolone neurosteroid, which is a stem hormone), in order to correct 15 mm of axotomized segment. The regenerated nerves were evaluated by means of electronic microscopy of transmission and light, performing cross cuts of 60-70 nm and 1 mu m in thickness for their histological analysis. The morphological findings showed a similar structure to that of an intact nerve, since the number of myelinated axons, not myelinated and the proportion "g" (which indicates the ripening degree of the axon), were similar, indicating that the regeneration of the axotomized nerves and tubulization was achieved, independently of the administered treatment.

AB This research integrates biomimetic modeling, solid freeform fabrication, systems and control, and tissue engineering in one intelligent system for structured, highly porous biomaterials, which will be applied to bone scaffolds. Currently we are developing a solid freeform fabrication system to make highly biocompatible and water soluble sucrose porogens. This research has conducted material studies on modified sucrose as a porogen material in its fluidity, viscosity, melting temperature, mechanical strength, and manufacturability. A new SFF-based manufacturing system using pressure based extrusion to print sucrose bone scaffold porogens has been developed. Porogen structure can be built by this system. In parallel we are utilizing a commercial Rapid Prototyping (RP) machine to fabricate thermoplastic porogens of various designs to determine the feasibility of injecting a highly viscous scaffold material into porogens. Materials which have been successfully used to make scaffolds by injection include CPC bone cement, molten poly-caprolactone (PCL), 90/10 and 80/20 percent by mass composite of poly-caprolactone (PCL) and calcium phosphate(CaPO4,). Results presented for the injection method include characterization of attainable feature resolution of the RP machine, as well as preliminary cell-biomaterial interaction data demonstrating biocompatibility of CPC scaffolds. The preliminary results using a commercial rapid prototyping machine have demonstrated that the indirect porogen technique can improve the resolution of SFF system by 2-4 times in fabricating bone scaffolds. The resultant scaffolds demonstrate that the defined porous structure will be suitable for tissue engineering applications.

AB The study of nervous system regeneration and axonal outgrowth control are relevant in several research areas, like neurophysiology or biomedical engineering. Among the elements that control neuron dynamics, the host substrate topography is a key parameter in determining cell differentiation. We present time-lapse experiments to analyze the differentiation dynamics of PC 12 cells on nanopatterned biocompatible substrates. 200 nm depth gratings were fabricated on tissue-culture polystyrene substrates by nanoimprint lithography; different linewidths and pitches were compared down to 500 nm and 1000 nm, respectively. PC12 cells were cultured on these substrates and, following NGF administration to the medium, body morphology, cell movement and neuritogenesis were monitored at different time periods. In addition to demonstrating guided differentiation, our studies show complex time variations in body morphology and axon length, and guided cell movement. We show unstable synaptic connections and cell-body polarization, and the competition between topographical guidance and cell-cell interactions.

Porous poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) [poly(HEMA)l rods were implanted for 7 days in the dorsal skin of C57 BL/6 mice. The porous poly(HEMA) rods were surface-modified with carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) or CDI plus laminin 5; unmodified rods served as control. Implant sites were sealed with 2-octyl cyanoacrylate; corn pads and adhesive dressings were tested for stabilization of implants. All rods remained intact for the duration of the study. There was histological evidence of both epidermal and dermal integration into all poly(HEMA) rods regardless of treatment. This in vivo model permits examination of the implant/skin interface and will be useful for future studies designed to facilitate skin cell attachment where percutaneous devices penetrate the skin.

TI Microgel particles containing methacrylic acid: pH-triggered swelling
   behaviour and potential for biomaterial application
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB pH-responsive microgels are crosslinked polymer particles that swell when the pH approaches the pK(a) of the ionic monomer incorporated within the particles. In recent work from our group it was demonstrated that the mechanical properties of degenerated intervertebral discs (IVDs) could be restored to normal values by injection of poly (EA/MAA/BDDA) (ethylacrylate, methacrylic acid and butanediol diacrylate) microgel dispersions [J.M. Saunders, T. Tong, C.L. Le Maitre, T.J. Freemont, B.R. Saunders, Soft Matter 3 (2007) 486]. In this work we report the pH dependent swelling and rheological properties of poly (MMA/MAA/EGDMA) (methyl methacrylate and ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate) microgel dispersions. This system was investigated because it contains monomers that are already used as biomaterials. The poly(MMA/MAA/EGDMA) particles exhibit pH-triggered volume swelling ratios of up to ca. 250. The swelling onset for these particles occurs at pH values greater than ca. 6.0. A pK(a) for these particles of ca. 6.7 is consistent with titration and swelling data. Fluid-to-gel phase diagrams for concentrated poly(MMA/MAA/EGDMA) dispersions were determined as a function of polymer volume fi-action and pH using tube-inversion measurements. The rheological properties for the gelled microgel dispersions were investigated using dynamic rheology measurements. The elastic modulus data for the poly(MMA/MAA/EGDMA) gelled dispersions were compared to data for poly(EA/MAA/BDDA) microgels. A similar pH-dependence for the elastic modulus was apparent. The maximum elastic modulus was achieved at a pH of about 7.0. The elastic modulus is an exponentially increasing function of polymer volume fraction at pH 7.0. Preliminary cell challenge experimental data are reported that indicate that gelled poly(MMA/MAA/EGDMA) microgel dispersions are biocompatible with cells from human intervertebral discs. However, the duration over which these experiments could be performed was limited by gradual redispersion of the gelled microgel dispersions. Based on the results presented it is suggested that poly(MMA/MAA/EGDMA) microgel would be a good candidate as a biomaterial for structural support of soft connective tissues. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

TI Mechanical properties of SiC ceramics by ultrasonic nondestructive
   technique and its bioactivity
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB Two SiC ceramics samples sintered at different firing temperatures, i.e. 1750, 1800 and 1900 degrees C were investigated through their mechanical properties using ultrasonic nondestructive technique. The velocity of longitudinal and shear ultrasonic waves were measured and used to calculate the longitudinal modulus (L), shear modulus (G), Young's modulus (E), bulk modulus (K) and Poisson's ratio (v). An attempt was done to use these materials as biomaterials. Simulated body fluids (SBF) containing inorganic concentrations close to human blood plasma was used to study the bioactivity of this material. The microstructure of SiC samples after immersion in SBF was investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results revealed that the longitudinal and shear ultrasonic velocities increase with increasing the sintering temperature in S1 and S2 and consequently increasing the mechanical properties. Generally, S I exhibited higher mechanical properties than S2 at 1900 degrees C. This is attributed to rigid framework, higher density and lower porosity. The obtained mechanical properties are favorable as compared with human cancellous bone and titanium for biomedical applications. It is then possible to conclude that SiC biomaterial implants appear as quite interesting alternative to Ti implants, by showing higher mechanical properties and lower density. Moreover, taking into account the biomechanical requirements (density, elastic modulus, strain to failure, etc.) of a particular type of bone in the body that should be repaired, bio SiC ceramics can be selected according the above properties.

   lamellar structure and a calcium binding site, and production of
   TS[(AG)(3)D(GA)(3)S](16) in Escherichia coli
SO MACROMOLECULES
AB In an attempt to produce mineralized composite materials with potential use as biomaterials or scaffolds for tissue engineering, we designed silklike peptides based on Ala-Gly repeated sequences with a lamellar structure and Asp as a Ca binding site in the turn part as in Tirrell's work (for example: Macromolecules 1996, 29, 1540-1553). We further modified the design of the lamella structure by introducing a Ser residue between (GlyAla)(3) and (AlaGly)(3) sequences. At first, we synthesized three labeled versions of 41SDSDS, (GlyAla)(3)Ser(AlaGly)(3)Asp(GlyAla)(3)Ser(AlaGly)(3)Asp(GlyAla)(3)Ser(AlaGly)(3), with (13)C labeling in different positions to characterize the lamellar structure using (13)C CP/MAS and spin-diffusion solid-state NMR. The beta-sheet fraction in Ala residues increased with increased distance from the Asp residue in the turn part. The introduced Ser residue took almost 100% beta-sheet structure probably because it forms an extra hydrogen bond stabilizing the stem part of (AlaGly). Thus, position-selective and sensitive information useful to characterize the detailed lamella structure; with heterogeneous local conformations, can be obtained by (13)C selective labeling of the peptide and determining (13)C conformation-dependent NMR chemical shifts. We then produced an analogous recombinant. protein, 14DS16, ThrSer[(AlaGly)(3)Asp(GlyAla)3Ser]16 in Escherichia coli as a possible biomaterial. Films of this protein treated with simulated body fluid were rapidly mineralized with hydroxyapatite.

TI Role of green tea polyphenol crosslinking alleviating
   ultraviolet-radiation effects on in collagen
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB The widespread application of collagen warrants studies on the effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on stabilized collagen. The negative impact of UV radiation is well known. Because collagen is used as a biomaterial in various biomedical applications, knowing the effects of UV irradiation on stabilized collagen has become essential. In this study, the effects of UV irradiation on collagen stabilized with green tea polyphenols, that is, Acacia mearnsii (wattle), and catechin has been studied. The fluorescence intensity has been found to decrease with irradiation for native and wattle-treated collagen. Spectral studies have indicated that the photo-degradation products increase after irradiation for native collagen, whereas collagen treated with catechin or A. mearnsii exhibits different responses depending on the duration of the irradiation. The duration of the irradiation has a significant influence on polyphenol-treated collagen. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether the elicited histologic response to synthetic and xenograft materials affected the tensile strength of mesh-reinforced repairs in the rat ventral hernia model.
   STUDY DESIGN: Hernias were repaired with Gynemesh, Pelvicol, Pelvisoft, or Surgisis ( representing incorporation, encapsulation, mixed incorporation and encapsulation, or resorption responses) and were compared with a suture-plicated control. Six animals per group were killed at 1 and 3 months after graft implantation. Preimplantation tensile strength was also measured for each graft material and native rat abdominal wall.
   RESULTS: Before implantation, Pelvicol had significantly higher adjusted tensile strength when compared with the rat abdominal wall (P < .001) or the other graft materials ( P <= .05). However, no difference in adjusted tensile strength was observed among the groups at 1 and 3 months after implantation.
   CONCLUSION: The elicited histologic response did not affect the adjusted tensile strength of xenograft or synthetic mesh-reinforced repairs when compared with suture controls.

TI Analytical investigations of poly(acrylic acid) coatings
   electrodeposited on titanium-based implants: a versatile approach to
   biocompatibility enhancement
SO ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB A polyacrylic acid film was synthesized on titanium substrates from aqueous solutions via an electroreductive process for the first time. This work was done in order to develop a versatile coating for titanium-based orthopaedic implants that acts as both an effective bioactive surface and an effective anti-corrosion barrier. The chemical structure of the PAA coating was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to evaluate the effect of annealing treatment on the morphology of the coatings in terms of their uniformity and porosity. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to measure ion concentrations in ion release tests performed on Ti-6Al-4V sheets modified with PAA coatings (annealed and unannealed). Results indicate that the annealing process produces coatings that possess considerable anti-corrosion performance. Moreover, the availability and the reactivity of the surface carboxylic groups were exploited in order to graft biological molecules onto the PAA-modified titanium implants. The feasibility of the grafting reaction was tested using a single aminoacid residue. A fluorinated aminoacid was selected, and the grafting reaction was monitored both by XPS, using fluorine as a marker element, and via quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements. The success of the grafting reaction opens the door to the synthesis of a wide variety of PAA-based coatings that are functionalized with selected bioactive molecules and promote positive reactions with the biological system interfacing the implant while considerably reducing ion release into surrounding tissues.

TI Gene expression characteristics of osteoblast differentiation in human
   umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells induced by demineralized bone
   matrix
SO ASIAN BIOMEDICINE
AB Background: Mesenchymal stem cells are multipotential cells capable of differentiating into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, tenocytes, and myoblasts. Wharton's jelly contains stem cells that are a rich source of primitive multipotent mesenchymal cells. Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) has been extensively utilized as a biomaterial to promote new bone formation.
   Objective: To isolate and characterize umbilical cord mesenchymal stem (UCMS) cells derived from Wharton's jelly and examine the biological activity of DBM in this cell line.
   Methods: Osteoblast differentiation of the UCMS cells was determined using alkaline phosphatase activity assay. To examine differential gene expression during osteoblast differentiation, total RNA was isolated from UCMS cells in the absence or presence of D,BM on day 7 and analyzed using osteogenesis cDNA gene array. The selected genes were verified using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain. reaction (RT-PCR) analysis.
   Results: Wharton's jelly derived cells could differentiate along an osteogenic lineage after treatment of DBM. Alkaline phosphatase activity assay showed that human UCMS cells could differentiate into osteogenic lineage. Gene expression of human UCMS cells treated with DBM for 7 days was analyzed by using cDNA array and RT-PCR analyses. We found that expression of runx2 and smad2 was upregulated whereas smad7 expression was downregulated as confirmed by RT-PCR.
   Conclusion: UCMS cells from a Wharton's jelly of human umbilical cord could express osteogenesis genes for treatment with DBM. Wharton's jelly from umbilical cord is a new source of mesenchymal stem cells that are readily available for application to bone tissue engineering.

TI Methacrylated glycol chitosan as a photopolymerizable biomaterial
SO BIOMACROMOLECULES
AB Glycol chitosan is a derivative of chitosan that is soluble at neutral pH and possesses potentially useful biological properties. With the goal of obtaining biocompatible hydrogels for use as tissue engineering scaffolds or drug delivery depots, glycol chitosan was converted to a photopolymerizable prepolymer through graft methacrylation using glycidyl methacrylate in aqueous media at pH 9. N-Methacrylation was verified by both H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR. The degree of N-methacrylation, measured via H-1 NMR, was easily varied from 1.5% to approximately 25% by varying the molar ratio of glycidyl methacrylate to glycol chitosan and the reaction time. Using a chondrocyte cell line, the N-methacrylated glycol chitosan was found to be noncytotoxic up to a concentration of 1 mg/mL. The prepolymer was cross-linked in solution using UV light and Irgacure 2959 photoinitiator under various conditions to yield gels of low sol content (similar to 5%), high equilibrium water content (85-95%), and thicknesses of up to 6 mm. Cross-polarization magic-angle spinning C-13 solid state NMR verified the complete conversion of the double bonds in the gel. Chondrocytes seeded directly onto the gel surface, populated the entirety of the gel and remained viable for up to one week. The hydrogels degraded slowly in vitro in the presence of lysozyme at a rate that increased as the cross-link density of the gels decreased.

TI Functionalized titanium oxide surfaces with phosphated carboxymethyl
   cellulose: Characterization and bonelike cell behavior
SO BIOMACROMOLECULES
AB The performance of dental or orthopedic implants is closely dependent on surface properties in terms of topography and chemistry. A phosphated carboxymethylcellulose containing one phosphate group for each disaccharide unit was synthesized and used to functionalize titanium oxide surfaces with the aim to improve osseointegration with the host tissue. The modified surfaces were chemically characterized by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The investigation of the surface topography was performed by atomic force microscopy measurements before and after the polysaccharide coating. In vitro biological tests using osteoblast-like cells demonstrated that functionalized TiO2 surfaces modulated cell response, in terms of adhesion, proliferation, and morphology. Phosphated carboxymethylcellulose promoted better cell adhesion and significantly enhanced their proliferation. The morphology of cells was polygonal and more spread on this type of modified surface. These findings suggest that the presence of a phosphate polysaccharide coating promotes osteoblast growth on the surface potentially improving biomaterial osseointegration.

TI Bone bonding at natural and biomaterial surfaces
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Bone bonding is occurring in each of us and all other terrestrial vertebrates throughout life at bony remodeling sites. The surface created by the bone-resorbing osteoclast provides a three-dimensionally complex surface with which the cement line, the first matrix elaborated during de novo bone formation, interdigitates and is interlocked. The structure and composition of this interfacial bony matrix has been conserved during evolution across species: and we have known for over a decade that this interfacial matrix can be recapitulated at a biomaterial surface implanted in bone, given appropriate healing conditions. No evidence has emerged to suggest that bone bonding to artificial materials is any different from this natural biological process. Given this understanding it is now possible to explain why bone-bonding biomaterials are not restricted to the calcium-phosphate-based bioactive materials as was once thought. Indeed. in the absence of surface porosity, calcium phosphate biomaterials are not bone bonding. On the contrary, non-bonding materials can be rendered bone bonding by modifying their surface topography. This paper argues that the driving force for bone bonding is bone formation by contact osteogenesis, but that this has to occur on a sufficiently stable recipient surface which has micronscale surface topography with undercuts in the sub-micron scale-range.

TI Phenotypic dichotomies in the foreign body reaction
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB To better understand the relationship between macrophage/foreign body giant cell adhesion and activation on surface-modified biomaterials. quantitative assessment of adherent cell density (cells per mm(2)) and cytokine production (pgs per mL) were determined by ELISA. Further analysis to identify cellular activation was carried out by normalizing the cytokine concentration data to provide a measure of cellular activation. This method of analysis demonstrated that hydrophobic surfaces provided statistically significantly greater adherent cell densities than hydrophilic/neutral surfaces. However, when cell activation parameters were determined by normalization to the adherent cell density, the hydrophilic/neutral surfaces demonstrated statistically significantly greater levels of activation and production of IL-10, IL-1 beta, IL-6. IL-8, and MIP-1 beta. With increasing time, production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased, whereas IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 decreased and MIP-1 beta was relatively constant over the culture time period. This observed dichotomy or disparity between adhesion and activation may be related to surface-induced adherent cell apoptosis. Further evaluation of macrophage activation on biomaterial surfaces indicated that an apparent phenotypic switch in macrophage phenotype occurred over the course of the in vitro culture. Analysis of cytokine/chemokine profiles with surface-modified biomaterials revealed similarities between the classically activated macrophages and the biomaterial-adherent macrophages early (day 3) in culture, while at later timepoints the biomaterial-adherent macrophages produced profiles similar to alternatively activated macrophages. Classically activated macrophages are those commonly activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and alternatively activated macrophages are those activated by IL-4/IL-13 or IL-10. Surface modification of biotnaterials offer an opportunity to control cellular activation and cytokine profiles in the phenotypic switch, and may provide a means by which macrophages can be induced to regulate particular secretory proteins that direct inflammation, the foreign body reaction, wound healing, and ultimately biocompatibility.

TI Biomaterial-mediated retroviral gene transfer using self-assembled
   monolayers
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Biomaterial-mediated gene delivery has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional gene transfer technologies that focus on direct delivery of viral vectors or DNA-polymer/matrix complexes. However, biomaterial-based strategies have primarily targeted transient gene expression vehicles, including plasmid DNA and adenovirus particles. This study expands on this work by characterizing biomaterial properties conducive to the surface immobilization of retroviral particles and subsequent transduction of mammalian cells at the cell-material interface. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of functionally-terminated alkanethiols on gold were used to establish biomaterial surfaces of defined chemical composition. Gene transfer was observed to be greater than 90% on NH2-terminated surfaces, approximately 50% on COOH-functionalized surfaces, and undetectable on CH3-terminated SAMs, similar to controls of tissue culture-treated polystyrene. Gene delivery via the NH2-SAM was further characterized as a function of retrovirus coating time, virus concentration, and cell seeding density. Finally, SAM-mediated gene delivery was comparable to fibronectin- and poly-L-lysine-based methods for gene transfer. This work is significant to establishing safe and effective gene therapy strategies, developing efficient methods for gene delivery, and supporting recent progress in the field of biomaterial-mediated gene transfer.

SO BIOMATERIALS
AB An innate immune response is often found at the site of biomaterial implantation. Since the effective use of biomaterials in vivo requires good biocompatibility and biofanetionality, it is vital that we assess and compare the inflammatory reactions provoked by various implanted biomaterials in vivo. In the present study, we assessed the host tissue response to poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)and small intestinal submucosa (SIS)-based scaffolds subcutaneously implanted in Fischer rats. Our results revealed that the PLGAbased scaffolds resulted in severe post-implantation inflammation, whereas the SIS-based scaffolds induced only a slight past implantation inflammation and a PLGA/SIS-based copolymer yielded intermediate results.

SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The biomaterials community has been unable to accurately assign the term "blood compatible" to a biomaterial in spite of 50 years of intensive research on the subject. There is no clear consensus as to which materials are "blood compatible." There are no standardized methods to assess blood compatibility. Since we use millions of devices in contact with blood each year, it is imperative we give serious thought to this intellectual catastrophe. In this perspective, I consider five hypotheses as to why progress has been slow in evolving a clear understanding of blood compatibility: Hypothesis 1-It is impossible to make a blood compatible material. Hypothesis 2-We do not understand the biology behind blood compatibility. Hypothesis 3-We do not understand how to test for or evaluate blood compatibility. Hypothesis 4-Certain materials of natural origin seem to show better blood compatibility but we do not know how to exploit this concept. Hypothesis 5-We now have better blood compatible materials but the regulatory and economic climate prevent adoption in clinical practice. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Assessing infection risk in implanted tissue-engineered devices
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Peri-operative contamination is the major cause of biomaterial-associated infections, highly complicating surgical patient outcomes. While this risk in traditional implanted biomaterials is well-recognised, newer cell-seeded, biologically conducive tissue-engineered (TE) constructs now targeted for human use have not been assessed for this possibility. We investigated infection incidence of implanted, degradable polyester TE scaffold biomaterials in rabbit knee osteochondral defects. Sterile, polyester copolymer scaffolds of different compositions and cell-accessible pore volumes were surgically inserted into rabbit osteochondral defects for periods of 3 weeks up to 9 months. either with or without initial seeding with autologous or allogeneic chondrocytes. Infection assessment included observation of pus or abscesses in or near the knee joint and post-mortem histological evaluation. Of 228 implanted TE scaffolds, 10 appeared to be infected: 6 scaffolds without cell seeding (3.6%) and 4 cell-seeded scaffolds (6.3%). These infections were evident across all scaffold types, independent of polymer composition or available pore volume, and up to 9 months. We conclude that infections in TE implants pose a serious problem with incidences similar to current biomaterials-associated infections. Infection control measures should be developed in tissue engineering to avoid further complications when TE devices emerge clinically. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Advancements in molecular epidemiology of implant infections and future
   perspectives
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Implant infection remains the major and often irreducible complication in clinical use of biomaterials, demanding new therapeutic and preventive strategies. Etio-pathogenesis of biomaterials-related infections is being more and more studied, and various virulence bacterial factors have progressively been identified, but little is still known about the weight of the distinct molecules in the context of specific peri-implant infection sites. Molecular epidemiology has become recently integrated into the research on implant infections. What distinguishes molecular epidemiology from the simple molecular biology is that the use of molecular techniques is applied to the study of the distribution and prevalence of virulence and resistance genes in collections of bacterial clinical isolates from implant infections. Here, the authors comment on the range of molecular techniques available, reviewing the various applications of molecular epidemiology to the study of implant infections and providing some experimental examples related to the field of orthopaedic implant infections. They highlight the new opportunities arising from molecular epidemiology of designing measures useful to prevent and treat implant infections. The knowledge of the relative weight of virulence factors and of their regulatory mechanisms at molecular level can open the way to new strategies also including gene therapies aimed at silencing or knocking out crucial genes responsible for the aggressive tools (adhesins, biofilm production, antibiotic resistance) of the aetiological agents of implant-related infections.

TI Cell culture models of higher complexity in tissue engineering and
   regenerative medicine
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Cell culture techniques have tended to be used in biomaterial research as a screening method prior to embarking on specific in vivo experimentation. This presentation aims at showing that it is possible to develop more sophisticated in vitro systems using primary human cells in co-culture with other cell types and biomaterials in a three-dimensional setting. While the predictive value of such systems is still not proven these models can be employed to unravel the complexity of biological systems in order to understand molecular mechanisms of cell-cell and cell-material interactions. The brief overview is under the headings of basic principles of relevant culture systems, the study of inflammation and the healing response, scenarios for specific biomaterial applications and future directions. How human endothelial cells can be usefully incorporated into more complex cell culture models is presented as an example of how relevant questions in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine can be addressed. The central tenet of this paper is that it is possible to refine in vitro methodology using cells of human origin to establish relevant assay systems that more closely simulate the cellular and molecular microenvironment encountered in a specific situation of regeneration using biomaterials.

TI Silk fibroin microtubes for blood vessel engineering
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Currently available synthetic grafts demonstrate moderate success at the macrovascular level, but fail at the microvascular scale ( <6 mm inner diameter). We report on the development of silk fibroin microtubes for blood vessel repair with several advantages over existing scaffold materials/designs. These microtubes were prepared by dipping straight lengths of stainless steel wire into aqueous silk fibroin, where the addition of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) enabled control of microtube porosity. The microtube properties were characterized in terms of pore size, burst strength, protein permeability, enzymatic degradation, and cell migration. Low porosity microtubes demonstrated superior mechanical properties in terms of higher burst pressures, but displayed poor protein permeability; whereas higher porosity tubes had lower burst strengths but increased permeability and enhanced protein transport. The microtubes also exhibited cellular barrier functions as low porosity tubes prevented outward migration of GFP-transduced HUVECs, while the high porosity microtubes allowed a few cells per tube to migrate outward during perfusion. When combined with the biocompatible and suturability features of silk fibroin, these results suggest that silk microtubes, either implanted directly or preseeded with cells, are an attractive biomaterial for microvascular grafts.

TI Engineering adipose-like tissue in vitro and in vivo utilizing human
   bone marrow and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells with silk fibroin
   3D scaffolds
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Biomaterials derived from silk fibroin prepared by aqueous (AB) and organic (HFIP) solvent-based processes, along with collagen (COL) and poly-lactic acid (PLA)-based scaffolds were studied in vitro and in vivo for their utility in adipose tissue engineering strategies. For in vitro studies, human bone marrow and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs and hASCs) were seeded on the various biomaterials and cultured for 21 days in the presence of adipogenic stimulants (AD) or maintained as noninduced controls. Alamar Blue analysis revealed each biomaterial supported initial attachment of hMSCs and hASCs to similar levels for all matrices except COL in which higher levels were observed. hASCs and hMSCs cultured on all biomaterials in the presence of AD showed significant upregulation ;of adipogenic mRNA transcript levels (LPL, GLUT4, FABP4, PPAR-gamma, adipsin, ACS) to similar extents when compared to noninduced controls. Similarly Oil-Red 0 analysis of hASC or hMSC-seeded scaffolds displayed substantial amounts of lipid accumulating adipocytes following cultivation with AD. The data revealed AB and HFIP scaffolds supported similar extents of lipid accumulating cells while PLA and COL scaffolds qualitatively displayed lower and higher extents by comparison, respectively. Following a 4-week implantation period in a rat muscle pouch defect model, both AB and HFIP scaffolds supported in vivo adipogenesis either alone or seeded with hASCs or hMSCs as assessed by Oil-Red 0 analysis, however the presence of exogenous cell sources substantially increased the extent and frequency of adipogenesis observed. In contrast, COL and PLA scaffolds underwent rapid scaffold degradation and were irretrievable following the implantation period. The results suggest that macroporous 3D AB and HFIP silk fibroin scaffolds offer an important platform for cell-based adipose tissue engineering applications, and in particular, provide longer-term structural integrity to promote the maintenance of soft tissue in vivo.

TI Expansion of human bone marrow stromal cells on
   poly-(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (P(DL)LGA) hollow fibres designed for use
   in skeletal tissue engineering
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Strategies to expand human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSC) for bone tissue engineering are a key to revolutionising the processes involved in three-dimensional skeletal tissue reconstruction. To facilitate this process we believe the use of biodegradable porous poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (P(DL)LGA) hollow fibres as a scaffold used in combination with HBMSC to initiate natural bone repair and regeneration offers a potential solution. In this study, the biocompatibility of 75:25 P(DL)LGA fibres with HBMSC and the capacity of a PDLLGA fibre-associated HBMSC-monolayer to establish an osteogenic phenotype in vivo was examined. A high proportion of HBMSC survived when expanded on PDLLGA fibres for 6 days, with only 10% of the propidium iodide (pI)-labelled population represented in the sub-G1 DNA peak on analysis by flow cytometry. Tracking carboxy-fluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFSE)labelled HBMSC by flow cytometry indicated that HBMSC attachment to the PDLLGA fibres does not interfere with their rate of proliferation. Furthermore, in response to osteogenic stimuli, HBMSC expanded on P(DL)LGA fibres can differentiate, as expected, along the osteogenic lineage with associated alkaline phosphatase activity. Following implantation into SCID mice, osteogenic-conditioned PDLLGA fibre-HBMSC graft resulted in type I collagen deposition and associated bone mineralisation and osteoid formation, as evidenced by immunohistochemistry and histology. These studies provide evidence that porous PDLLGA hollow fibre-HBMSC graft is an innovative biomaterial that offers new approaches to mesenchymal cell expansion, which could be utilised as a scaffold for skeletal tissue generation.

TI Development and evaluation of silk fibroin-based nerve grafts used for
   peripheral nerve regeneration
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Silk fibroin (SF), derived from natural silk long used as a textile material, has recently become an important biomaterial for tissue engineering applications. We have previously reported on good in vitro biocompatibility of SF fibers with peripheral nerve tissues and cells. In the present study, we developed a novel biomimetic design of the SF-based nerve graft (SF graft) which was composed of a SF-nerve guidance conduit (NGC) inserted with oriented SF filaments. The SF-NGC prepared via well-established procedures exhibits an eggshell-like microstructure that is responsible for its superior mechanical and permeable properties beneficial to nerve regeneration. The SF graft was used for bridge implantation across a 10-mm long sciatic nerve defect in rats, and the outcome of peripheral nerve repair at 6 months post-implantation was evaluated by a combination of electrophysiological assessment, FluoroGold retrograde tracing and histological investigation. The examined functional and morphological parameters show that SF grafts could promote peripheral nerve regeneration with effects approaching those elicited by nerve autografts which are generally considered as the gold standard for treating large peripheral nerve defects, thus raising a potential possibility of using these newly developed nerve grafts as a promising alternative to nerve autografts.

SO BULLETIN OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were employed to test borided CP-Ti, treated by a relatively new method called pulsed plasma electrolytic boriding. The results show excellent corrosion resistance for modified CP-Ti. The effect of frequency and duty cycle of pulsed current was investigated. It was found that pulse frequency and duty cycle affect the size and porosity of nanocrystalline borides and by controlling these effective parameters, surface modification can render the CP-Ti material extremely corrosion resistant as a biomaterial.

TI Reliable evidences that the removal mechanism of hexavalent chromium by
   natural biomaterials is adsorption-coupled reduction
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB For the last few decades, over 200 papers have been published in the Cr(VI) biosorption research field. Most early studies have claimed that Cr(VI) was removed from aqueous phase through an anionic adsorption, but this approach has been lost old original position. It has been newly explained that these findings were misinterpreted due to errors in measuring the concentrations of different chromium species in the aqueous phase, insufficient contact time required for equilibrium and the lack of information about the oxidation state of the chromium bound to biomaterials. Although 'adsorption-coupled reduction' is now widely accepted as the mechanism of Cr(VI) biosorption by natural biomaterials, a number of researchers still believe that Cr(VI) is removed by anionic adsorption onto the biomaterials. Therefore, the objective of this study was to show reliable evidences that the removal mechanism of Cr(VI) by natural biomaterials is 'adsorption-coupled reduction'. Sixteen natural biomaterials were used to study the Cr(VI) biosorption. Not only Cr(VI) but also total Cr in the aqueous phase were analyzed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscope was also used to verify the oxidation state of the chromium bound to the biomaterials. Finally, the removal behavior of Cr(VI) by each biomaterial was described by a kinetic model based on a redox reaction. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Not all zirconia femoral heads degrade in vivo
SO CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH
CT Open Meeting of the Hip-Society
CY 2007
CL San Diego, CA
AB Degradation of yttria-stabilized zirconia femoral heads in vivo has been linked to increased roughening and even fracture of the femoral head. To determine whether magnesia-stabilized zirconia is better suited to resist degradation, we characterized the monoclinic phase concentration, surface topography, and microhardness of retrieved zirconia femoral heads. From previous work, we expected yttria-stabilized zirconia heads to undergo considerable tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation in vivo, leading to considerably increased roughness and decreased microhardness, whereas magnesia-stabilized zirconia heads would not experience phase transformation and thus would not roughen or exhibit decreased microhardness. We studied seven yttria-stabilized zirconia and 12 magnesia-stabilized zirconia femoral heads. Yttria-stabilized zirconia heads explanted after 5 years exhibited a rough orange peel-like surface under light microscopy and were rougher than magnesia-stabilized zirconia heads (average roughness approximately 20 nm versus 7.5 nm, respectively), likely attributable to increased monoclinic phase transformation (approximately 37% by weight) caused by low-temperature aging. The microhardness of yttria-stabilized zirconia heads decreased with age, but the relationship was not noteworthy. In contrast, magnesia-stabilized zirconia retrievals showed no change in monoclinic phase concentration, surface roughness, or microhardness with age. The properties of the yttria-stabilized zirconia evaluated in our study deteriorated in vivo, whereas magnesia-stabilized zirconia did not degrade and appears to be a superior biomaterial for bearing in total joint arthroplasty.

TI In situ tensile deformation of zein films with plasticizers and filler
   materials
SO FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS
AB Material deformation is a dynamic process. Visualisation of this deformation can help to understand the local deformation and fracture behaviour. Zein (the prolamin protein from maize) films with different amount of plasticizers (0-25%) and different filler materials (maize oil, Dimodan (R), Vestosint (R)), at 25% (w/w) to protein) were deformed under tension and observed at micron scale in real time by a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). The addition of plasticizers increased strain and decreased stress of zein films. At low level of plasticizers (6.25% and 12%), zein films deformed and fracture through micro-crack formation and propagation normal the tensile axis. At high Plasticization, only micro-pores were observed during tensile deformation. The filler material oil and Dimodan (R)( increased, but Vestosint (R)) decreased tensile strain in comparison to the control. This shows that the fracture dynamic is affected by the filler materials and is indeed observed by the CLSM. Analysis of local strain by Fluospheres (R) as particle tracking showed a good linear correlation with the tensile strain of the plasticized zein films. The local strains of filler materials and zein matrix in the films were different from the overall tensile strain. The combination of CLSM with a fluospheres (R) as particle tracking is a good method to study local deformation in biomaterials to understand the deformation and fracture behaviour of biomaterials.

TI Actin cytoskeletal organization in human osteoblasts grown on different
   dental titanium implant surfaces
SO HISTOLOGY AND HISTOPATHOLOGY
AB The understanding of the cellular basis of osteoblastic cell-biomaterial interaction is crucial to the analysis of the mechanism of osseointegration. Cell adhesion is a complex process that is dependent on the cell types and on the surface microtopography and chemistry of the substrate.
   We have studied the role of microtopography in modulating cell adhesion, in vitro, using a human osteoblastic cell line for the assessment of actin cytoskeletal organization. Through application of CLSM combining reflection and fluorescence, 2D or 3D images of cytoskeleton were obtained.
   On smooth surfaces, Ti CP machined, predominantly planar bone cells with an axial ratio of 1.1 were randomly oriented, with stress fibers running in all directions, and thin filopodia.
   On TiCP Osseotite((R)) surfaces the osteoblastic cells conformed to the irregular terrain of the sustrate with focal adhesion sites only established on the relative topographical peaks separated for a longer distance than in the machined surface, and defined wide lamellopodia and long filopodia, with enhanced expression of stress fibers, forming large clear focal contacts with the rough surface. The cytoskeletal organization of cells cultured on rough titanium supports an active role for the biomaterial surface in the events that govern osteoblastic cell adhesion. The results enforce the role of the rough sustrate surface in affecting osteoblastic cell adhesion and provide valuable information for the design of material surfaces that are required for the development of an appropriate osteogenic surface for osteoblastic anchorage, compared to machined surface, in dental implants.

TI Effects of dernineralized freeze-dried bone allograft on gene expression
   of osteoblastlike MG63 cells
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PERIODONTICS & RESTORATIVE DENTISTRY
AB Demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) is widely used in periodontal regeneration procedures as a scaffold for new bone formation in periodontal defects. How this biomaterial alters osteoblast activity to promote bone formation is poorly understood. We therefore attempted to address this question by using microarray techniques to identify genes that are differently regulated in osteoblasts exposed to DFDBA. By using DNA microarrays containing 20,000 genes, the authors identified in an osteablastlike cell line (MG-63) cultured with DFDBA (Allogro, Dentsply/Friadent-Ceramed) several genes whose expression was significantly up-regulated or down-regulated. The differently expressed genes cover a broad range of functional activities: (1) cell cycle regulation, (2) immunity, (3) vesicular transport, (4) production of cytoskeletal elements, and (5) bone remodeling. The data reported are, to the authors' knowledge, the first genetic portrait of DFDBA effects. They can be relevant to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of bone regeneration and as a model for comparing other materials with similar clinical effects.

TI Investigation of synthesis of PVP hydrogel by irradiation
SO IRANIAN JOURNAL OF RADIATION RESEARCH
AB Background: A dressing often covers the wound to accelerate its healing. Hydrocolloid-type dressing to give better conditions for healing has been developed consisting of gelatin, pectin, water and hydrophilic polymer which promote healing. In recent years, much attention has been focused on the research and development of polymer hydrogels as biomaterials, such as contact lenses, wound dressing and drug-delivery systems. Materials and Methods: Hydrogels, as wound dressing were prepared with composite poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrolidone) (PVP) with several additives such as agar and polyethylenglycol (PEG) and by electron-beam. Electron beam was applied as a tool for initiation of crosslinking and sterilization of these materials. The effects of irradiation dose at the range of 10-40 KGy and various concentration of components on the characterizes of hydrogel such as gel content, degree of swelling (DS), equilibrium water content (EWC) and dehydration properties, transparency and microbial test were investigated. Results: After irradiation, the achieved gel content of hydrogels was obtained higher than 25%. Gels' degree of swelling with different concentrations was changed from 35 to 20 at the range of irradiation dose of 10-40 KGy. Also, at the same range of irradiation and concentration, EWC of gels was found to be 98 to 94 %. The dehydration results did not show variation with the tested parameters. Conclusion: Results showed that hydrogels membrane with composition PVP (10% w/w), agar and PEG (1-3%w/w) at the dose of 25 KGy had the amount of gel content 80-85%. Their IDS and EWC were respectively obtained 30% and 96.5%. They were elastic, transparent, flexible, sterile and impermeable for bacteria. They absorbed a high capacity of water, attached to healthy skin, and they were easy to remove. It was concluded that the network was solely composed of crosslinked PVP plasticized by other compounds.

TI Proteomic analysis and quantification of cytokines and chemokines from
   biomaterial surface-adherent macrophages and foreign body giant cells
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Implantation of biomaterial devices results in the well-known foreign body reaction consisting of monocytes, macrophages, and foreign body giant cells (FBGCs) at the material/tissue interface. We continue to address the hypothesis that material surface chemistry modulates the phenotypic expression of these cells. Utilizing our human monocyte culture system, we have used surface-modified polymers displaying hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and/or ionic chemistries to determine the cytokines/chemokines released from biomaterial-adherent macrophages/FBGCs. This study broadens our approach by using proteomic analysis to identify important factors expressed by these cells and further quantifies these molecules with ELISAs. Proteomic profiles changed over time suggesting that the adherent macrophages underwent a phenotypic switch. Macrophage/FBGC-derived proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1 beta and IL-6, decreased with time, while the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, gradually increased with time. Resolution of the inflammatory response was also demonstrated by a decrease in chemoattractant IL-8 and MIP-1 beta production with time. Material-dependent macrophage/FBGC activation was analyzed using cytokine/chemokine production and cellular adhesion. Monocyte/macrophage adhesion was similar on all surfaces, except for the hydrophilic /neutral surfaces that showed a significant decrease in cellular density and minimal FBGC formation. Normalizing the ELISA data based on the adherent cell population provided cytokine/chemokine concentrations produced per cell. This analysis showed that although there were fewer cells on the hydrophilic /neutral surface, these adherent cells were further activated to produce significantly greater amounts of each cytokine/chemokine tested than the other surfaces. This study clearly presents evidence that material surface chemistry can differentially affect monocyte/ macrophage/FBGC adhesion and cytokine/chemokine profiles derived from activated macrophages/FBGCs adherent to biomaterial surfaces.

TI Monocyte activation in response to polyethylene glycol hydrogels grafted
   with RGD and PHSRN separated by interpositional spacers of various
   lengths
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is often cited as a "stealth" polymer, capable of resisting both protein adsorption and cell adhesion. By extension, PEG would then be expected to limit the host response. Monocyte-derived macrophages play an integral role in inflammation, and thus their response to a material can potentially dictate the overall host response to a biomaterial. In the present study, monocyte responses following interaction with a photopolymerized PEG hydrogel were compared with those from standard tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). Additionally, the effect of the spacing between RGD and PHSRN, the corresponding synergy sequence on fibronectin (FN), was evaluated using peptides with differing spacer lengths grafted to the PEG hydrogel. Monocyte adherent density on the PEG-only hydrogel was comparable with that of TCPS; however, the secretion of the proinflammatory molecules interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) increased dramatically following monocyte interaction with PEG-only hydrogels as compared with TCPS. The matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) concentration was similar for all surfaces, while both the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and FN concentrations were above the range of the assay for all substrates. Cell density was higher on the PHSRNG(13)RGD grafted substrate as compared with PHSRNG(6)RGD, but neither sequence increased cell density versus RGD alone. Although protein concentration did sometimes vary with different peptides, this variation was minimal in comparison with the surface effects between TCPS and the PEG-only hydrogel. This study explores the roles of PEG and FN-derived peptides on monocyte activation. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Human monocyte adhesion onto RGD and PHSRN peptides delivered to the
   surface of a polycarbonate polyurethane using bioactive fluorinated
   surface modifiers
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Fluorinated oligomers, when blended into polyurethane, have been shown to migrate to the surface and generate an interface that minimizes protein denaturation and reduces cell activation. This type of surface modification can be achieved with ppm quantities of a bioactive fluorinated surface modifier (BFSM), enabling the introduction of bioactive agents onto a surface in one manufacturing step. In the current study, two BFSMs were synthesized with covalently conjugated RGD and PHSRN peptides near the fluorine terminal groups, and were shown to be surface active in polyurethane blends. CyQuant cell enumeration, scanning electron microscopy, and cell viability assays all indicated that the bioactive (and fluorinated) substrates supported enhanced monocyte interaction. The simplicity of the surface modification technique and the demonstrated ability of the peptide BFSMs to influence cell attachment and spreading indicate the potential benefits and practical value of the BFSM technology in tailoring surfaces for biomaterial applications. This was specifically highlighted for human blood monocytes, a key cell involved in the early stages of wound healing. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Structure, depolymerization, and cytocompatibility evaluation of glycol
   chitosan
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Glycol chitosan, a water soluble chitosan derivative being investigated as a new biomaterial, was fractionated via two different methods. Initial characterization of the glycol chitosan with H-1 NMR spectroscopy illustrated the presence of both secondary and tertiary amine groups, contradictory to its widely accepted structure. Fractionation of glycol chitosan with nitrous acid resulted in a significant reduction in the number average molecular weight, specifically, from 170 to similar to 7 kDa for a pH 3 and below. However, the reaction altered its chemical structure, as the secondary amine groups were converted to N-nitrosamines, which are potentially carcinogenic. An increase in the pH of the reaction limited this formation, but not entirely. Free radical degradation initiated with potassium persulfate was not as effective at reducing the molecular weight as the nitrous acid approach, yielding molecular weights around 12 kDa under the same molar ratio of degrading species, but did retain the structural integrity of the glycol chitosan. Additionally, control of the molecular weight appears feasible with potassium persulfate. When assessed in vitro for cytocompatibility, the polymer exhibited no toxicity on monolayer-cultured chondrocytes, and in fact stimulated cell growth at low concentrations.

TI Quick-forming hydroxyapatite/agarose gel composites induce bone
   regeneration
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB We investigated the fundamental properties of quick-forming hydroxyapatite (HAp)/agarose gel composites, and evaluated their potential as an injectable bone substitute. From scanning electron microscope observations, the HAp/agarose gel composites produced by an innovative electrophoretic process showed an interconnecting structure with the HAp particles. The diameter of the HAp particles was roughly 1 mu m, and the total amount of HAp particles was estimated by a quantification of the calcium ions. In the case of 1 mg of dry composite, 10 mu g of HAp was formed in the agarose gel. Moreover, X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the HAp particles had an amorphous structure, so the HAp particles were expected to dissolve under physiological conditions relative to the HAp with higher crystallinity. The advantages of the resultant HAp/agarose gel composites are ease of handling, close contact with the surrounding tissues, and ease of use as an injectable material. As a preliminary animal study, the composites were implanted into the medial femoral condyle of rabbits. After implantation, the process of bone regeneration was evaluated by microfocus-computed tomography (mu CT) and histological analysis. At 2 weeks postoperatively, newly-formed bone was observed at the edge of the bone defect site, and at 4 weeks postoperatively, excellent bone regeneration was observed. The implanted composite gradually degraded, and disappeared at 8 weeks postoperatively. This result indicated that the composite dissolved rapidly, and was replaced by newly-formed bone. Quick-forming HAp/agarose gel composites may be a good candidate as an injectable biomaterial, particularly in the fields of orthopedic, oral, and maxillofacial surgery.

TI Gadofullerenes and gadonanotubes: A new paradigm for high-performance
   magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent probes
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB In this review, the physicochemical properties and biomedical applications of Gd@C(60) (gado-fullerenes) and Gd@ Ultra-short Single-walled carbon nanotubes (gadonanotubes) are discussed, especially in regard to the unique benefits of this novel class of materials for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The introduction of carbon nanotechnology into biomaterial science has created great opportunity for improving medical diagnostics and therapeutics. In this regard, derivatized gadofullerenes and gadonanotubes offer a new nanoscale paradigm for the design of high-performance MRI contrast agent (CA) probes with efficacies up to 100 times greater than current clinical CAs. Studies show that such CAs are well suited for both passive (magnetic labels for cells) and active (pH-sensitive probes) MRI-based molecular imaging. This capability might lead, for example, to the detection of molecular components or processes that are at the cause of disease. The various important physicochemical factors or parameters discussed in this work provide valuable insight into the development of not only other carbon nanostructure-based MRI contrast agents, but for any fullerene-based biomedical application.

TI Topical application of laminin-332 to diabetic mouse wounds
SO JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGICAL SCIENCE
AB Background: Keratinocyte migration is essential for wound heating and diabetic wound keratinocytes migrate poorly. Keratinocyte migration and anchorage appears to be mediated by laminin-332 (LM-332). Impaired diabetic wound heating may be due to defective LM-332 mediated keratinocyte migration.
   Objective: To evaluate LM-332 expression in diabetic (db/db) and control (db/-) mice and to test LM-332 wound heating effects when applied to mouse wounds.
   Methods: LM-332 expression in mouse wounds was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. LM-332 wound heating effects were evaluated by directly applying soluble LM-332, a LM-332 biomaterial, or a control to mouse wounds. Percent wound closure and histology score, based on heating extent, were measured.
   Results: Precursor LM-332 expression was markedly reduced in db/db when compared to db/- mice. In vitro, soluble LM-332 and LM-332 biomaterial demonstrated significant keratinocyte adhesion. In vivo, soluble LM-332 treated wounds had the highest histology score, but significant differences were not found between wound treatments (p > 0.05). No differences in percentage wound closure between treatment and control wounds were found (p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: The db/db wounds express less precursor LM-332 when compared to db/-. However, LM-332 application did not improve db/db wound heating. LM-332 purified from keratinocytes was primarily physiologically cleaved LM-332 and may not regulate keratinocyte migration. Application of precursor LM-332 rather than cleaved LM-332 may be necessary to improve wound heating, but this isoform is not currently available in quantities sufficient for testing.

TI Models for ohmic heating of solid-liquid mixtures under worst-case
   heating scenarios
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING
AB Sterilization of solid-liquid mixtures by ohmic heating requires the assurance that all parts of the food or biomaterial in question is treated adequately to ensure inactivation of pathogenic sporeforniers. Previous work has identified worst-case scenarios as being associated with a single solid piece (inclusion particle) of substantially different electrical conductivity than its surroundings. Two potentially hazardous situations were modeled, both involving an inclusion particle, but one involving a static medium surrounding the solid; and the other involving a mixed fluid, with a circuit theory analysis for the electric field. Results indicate that the mixed fluid model provides a more conservative prediction of mixture cold-spot temperatures than the static model when the cold-spot occurs within the particle; typically occurring when the medium is more conductive than the solid. However, the static fluid model provides more conservative prediction of the mixture cold-spot temperatures when the cold-spot is within the fluid; typically when the solid is more conductive than the medium. Our results underline the need to evaluate both scenarios in evaluating the potential for an underprocessed region. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Synthesis and characterization of amphiphilic block copolymers with
   allyl side-groups
SO JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE PART A-POLYMER CHEMISTRY
AB The synthesis of a new cyclic carbonate monomer containing an allyl group was reported and its biodegradable amphiphilic block copolymer, poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(L-lactide-co-5-methyl-5-allyloxycarbonyl-propylene carbonate) [PEG-b-P(LA-co-MAC)] was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of L-lactide (LA) and 5-methyl-5-allyloxycarbonyl-1,3-dioxan-2-one (MAC) in the presence of poly (ethylene glycol) as a macroinitiator, with diethyl zinc as a catalyst. C-13 NMR and H-1 NMR were used for microstructure identification of the copolymers. The copolymer could form micelles in aqueous solution. The core of the micelles is built of the hydrophobic P(LA-co-MAC) chains, whereas the shell is set up by the hydrophilic PEG blocks. The micelles exhibited a homogeneous spherical morphology and unimodal size distribution. By using the cyclic carbonate monomer containing allyl side-groups, crosslinking of the PEG-b-P(LA-co-MAC) inner core was possible. The adhesion and spreading of ECV-304 cells on the copolymer were better than that on PLA films. Therefore, this biodegradable amphiphilic block copolymer is expected to be used as a biomaterial for drug delivery and tissue engineering. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Laser shock flier impact simulation of particle-substrate interactions
   in cold spray
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB Coating-substrate adhesion in cold spray is a paramount property, the mechanisms of which are not yet well elucidated. To go into these mechanisms, due to the intrinsic characteristics of the cold spray process (particle low-temperature and high velocity) direct observation and control of inflight particles and related phenomena cannot be done easily. For this reason, an experimental simulation of the particle-substrate reactions at the particle impingement was developed. This simulation is based on original flier impact experiments from laser shock acceleration. Relevant interaction phenomena were featured and studied as a function of shearing, plastic deformation, phase transformation primarily. These phenomena were shown to he similar to those involved in cold spray. This was ascertained by the study of the Cu-Al metallurgically reactive system using SEM, TEM, EPMA, and energy balance and diffusion calculations. This simulation could also be used to feed finite element modeling of cold spray and laser shock flier impact.

AB Hydroxyapatite (HAp Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2)) is known to be a biomaterial and an adsorbent for chromatography. In this study, HAp was agglomerated with anatase TiO2 to manufacture thermal-spray powders to improve the adsorption activity of TiO2, and then to improve its photocatalytic activity. The microstructures, compositions and photocatalytic activity of plasma-sprayed TiO2, TiO2-10%HAp, TiO2-30% HAp, and HAp coatings were investigated. Due to the low thermal conductivity of HAp compound, not all HAp particles fully melted even under the arc current of 800 A. The addition of HAp inhibited the phase transformation of anatase TiO2 to rutile. Under the arc current of 600 A, the anatase content in the TiO2, TiO2-10%HAp and TiO2-30%HAp coatings was 11, 20 and 42%, respectively. With the increasing of the spraying distance from 70 to 110 mm, the anatase content in the TiO2-30%HAp coatings decreased from 34 to 17% under arc current of 700 A. Furthermore, a slight decomposition of HAp to alpha-Ca-3(PO4)(2) was found in the TiO2-30%HAp coatings, it did not decompose to CaO and P2O5 according to the XRD and EDAX analysis. The addition of the secondary gas of helium had no significant influence on the melting state of the TiO2-HAp feedstock powders. Moreover, the HAp in the TiO2-10%HAp and TiO2-30%HAp coatings had adsorption characteristic to acetaldehyde. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2-10%HAp coating was highest among TiO2, TiO2-10%HAp, and TiO2-30%HAp coatings sprayed under the arc current of 600 A for the optimum adsorption property and anatase content.

TI A mathematical verification of the reinforced-matrix hypothesis using
   the Mori-Tanaka theory
SO JOURNAL OF WOOD SCIENCE
AB This article presents a theoretical verification of the reinforced-matrix hypothesis derived from tensor equations, sigma(W) = sigma(f) + sigma(m) and epsilon(W) = epsilon(f) = epsilon(m) ( Wood Sci Technol 32:171-182, 1998; Wood Sci Technol 33:311-325, 1999; J Biomech Eng 124:432-440, 2002), using classical Mori-Tanaka theory on the micromechanics of fiber-reinforced materials ( Acta Metall 21:571-574, 1973; Micromechanics-dislcation and inclusions ( in Japanese), pp 141-147, 1976). The Mori-Tanaka theory was applied to a small fragment of the cell wall undergoing changes in its physical state, such as those arising from sorption of moisture, maturation of wall components, or action of an external force, to obtain <sigma(A)>(D) = phi.<sigma (F)>(I) + (1 - phi) .<sigma(M)>(D-I). When the constitutive equation of each constituent material was applied to the equation <sigma(A)>(D) = phi.<sigma(F)>(I) + (1 - phi).<sigma(M)>(D-I), the equations sigma(W) = sigma(f) + sigma(m) and epsilon(W) = epsilon(f) = epsilon(m) were derived to lend support to the concept that two main phases, the reinforcing cellulose microfibril and the lignin - hemicellulose matrix, coexist in the same domain. The constitutive equations for the cell wall fragment were obtained without recourse to additional parameters such as Eshelby's tensor S and Hill's averaged concentration tensors A(F) and A(M). In our previous articles, the coexistence of two main phases and sigma(W) = sigma(f) + sigma(m) and epsilon(W) = epsilon(f) = epsilon(m) had been taken as our starting point to formulate the behavior of wood fiber with multilayered cell walls. The present article provides a rational explanation for both concepts.

TI Synthesis and in vitro bioactivity of a borate-based bioglass
SO MATERIALS LETTERS
AB A bioactive borate glass was synthesized through normal melting-derived route in this letter. The degradation and bioactivity of the glass were studied by the immersion of glass microspheres in a dilute K2HPO4 solution. The cell growth inhibition rate of the borate glass was examined by MTT assay. The conversion product of the borate glass was identified by XRD, SEM. It was confirmed that the borate glass had a rapid degradation rate, comparing with the silicate-based bioglass, 45S5 glass. HA formed from the borate glass, that is an indication of bioactive potential in vivo. MTT assay results demonstrate that the inhibition effect of B ions released from the borate glass on cell proliferation can be alleviated by diluting extract solution to a certain concentration (v/v ratio: 1:4, [B] < 1.792 mM). It is believed that the borate glass could be a desirable biomaterial for preparing scaffold of tissue engineering. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

TI Enhancement of biocompatibility on bioactive Ti-Nb-based alloy by
   high-density plasma modification
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB The formations and characteristics of oxides on the surfaces of the plasma-treated Ti-Nb-Hf alloys were investigated by employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffractometer and scanning electron microscopy. Further, the non-treated and plasma-treated specimens were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing albumin to evaluate their biocompatibility. The results indicate that through O-2-plasma treatment, the thickness of the oxide layer increases, and the surface roughness improves, exhibiting little protuberances and numerous micropores and cavities on the treated surface. The compositions of the oxide layers in the specimen without O-2-plasma treatment consist of TiO, Ti2O3 and TiO2, and the oxides transform to mainly TiO2 as the specimen is treated with O-2-plasma. In addition, the formation of nitrides by allylamine plasma treatment can provide amino-group linkings for the attachment of albumin. Plasma oxidation and polymerization are believed to improve biocompatibility and therefore promote osseointegration.

AB Bacterial adhesion to surfaces is a complicated process influenced by many factors including the bacteria (surface energy and charge, molecular details), the substratum surface (chemical composition, roughness, configuration, surface energy and charge) and environmental factors (serum proteins, flow conditions, temperature, bacterial concentration, time of exposure, antibiotics). The models that have been proposed for the quantitative prediction of bacteria-material interactions are based on colloidal theories and macromolecular binding considerations. Two categories of techniques used in calculating bacterial adhesion strength and bacteria-material interactions have been proposed: those that utilize fluid flowing against adherent bacteria and those that manipulate single bacteria (atomic force microscopy and optical tweezers), and are concisely reviewed.

SO MATERIALWISSENSCHAFT UND WERKSTOFFTECHNIK

SP Germany Soc Biomat
AB The covalent and non-covalent immobilization of growth factors such as recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP-2) on metals and bone replacement materials in bioactive form is a recent development. Up to now the immobilization technology usually involved the chemical modification and activation of the biomaterial surface followed by attachment of the bioactive protein. Here we suggest an alternative method in which an affinity tag fused to an active protein will allow immobilization without additional chemistry. For biomaterials such as minerals, metals (titanium, steel, CoCrMo), glass ceramics, teflon and possibly bone and teeth ideal adhesion molecules would be the foot proteins (Mefps) of the mussel M. edulis which contain the rare amino acid dihydroxy phenylalanine (DOPA). Recently it could be shown by Messersmith's group that a single DOPA-molecule can be non-covalently bound to titanium dioxide surface with a dissociation energy of 22.2 kcal/mol (Lee, H.; Scherer, N. E; Messersmith, P. B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A 2006, 103, 12999-13003). We therefore propose the DOPA-tag as a general and versatile affinity tag for the immobilization of proteins on biomaterials.

TI Bioactive glass hydroxyapatite in fronto-orbital defect reconstruction
SO PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
AB Background: Synthetic bioactive ceramics and glasses have osteoconductive properties. These materials are capable of chemically bonding to the bone tissue. In addition, special bioactive glasses do not favor microbial growth. In this study, the clinical outcome of bioactive glass and hydroxyapatite in head and neck surgery was evaluated.
   Methods: In a retrospective series of 150 patients, 62 patients underwent reconstruction with frontal sinus obliteration after chronic frontal sinusitis, 65 patients were operated on for fronto-orbital traumas, and 23 patients under-went reconstruction after fronto-orbital tumor resections. These patients were evaluated for surgical procedures, reconstruction materials, complications, and functional outcomes.
   Results: Three of the 62 frontal sinus occlusions under-went operation (4.8 percent) during the follow-up of 5 years. The reoperations were caused by a new mucocele. In fronto-orbital reconstructions, we have reoperated on the orbital floor in four cases (7 percent). All 12 benign tumor patients and six of 11 malignant tumor patients survived during a follow-up of 3 years. Two of the 23 (9 percent) complicated tumor and trauma patients under-went reoperation because of a local mucocele.
   Conclusions: Treatment of severe head and neck defects with biomaterial is a suitable alternative to conventional methods. Bioactive materials seem to be stable and reliable at clinical follow-up. The reconstructions with bioactive glass and hydroxyapatite are associated with good functional and aesthetic results without donor-site morbidity. However, more long-term outcomes of studied biomaterials are needed to determine whether they are capable of competing with traditional tissue grafts.

TI Fabrication of an optimal urethral graft using collagen-sponge tubes
   reinforced with copoly(L-lactide/epsilon-caprolactone) fabric
SO TISSUE ENGINEERING
AB An ideal biomaterial for urethral reconstruction has not been developed. To create a urethral graft biomaterial with optimal biodegradability and biocompatibility, a copoly(L-lactide/epsilon-caprolactone) [P(LA/ CL)] fabric tube was combined with a type I collagen sponge. The P(LA/CL) fibers were knitted into a vascular stent style (Type 1) or weaved into a mesh style (Type 2) to prepare P(LA/CL) tubes. The tubes were dipped in aqueous collagen solution and lyophilyzed to prepare the P(LA/CL)-collagen sponge graft. The grafts were applied to a 1.5-cm rabbit urethral defect (n = 14 for each condition), and tissue repair was evaluated using urethrographical, urethroscopical, and histological examination 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery. Although epithelialization was observed after 1 month in all Type 1 grafts, stenoses, fistulae, or stone formation was seen in 7 of the rabbits. In some cases, P(LA/CL) fibers prolapsed into the urethral lumen, causing stone formation. Only 3 rabbits survived for 6 months, and 2 of these had stenoses. For the Type 2 graft, all urethras were patent, without fistulae or stenoses, over the entire observation period. Histologically, urethral structure was disorganized for the Type 1 graft, whereas the urethral tissue on the Type 2 graft was slightly fibrotic but completely epithelialized and supported by a regenerated smooth muscle layer at 6 months. These findings suggest that creation of a scaffold suitable for urethral tissue regeneration will depend not only on the biomaterial composition, but also on the fabrication technique.

TI Genetically modified crops for the bioeconomy: meeting public and
   regulatory expectations
SO TRANSGENIC RESEARCH
AB As the United States moves toward a plant-based bioeconomy, a large research and development effort is focused on creating new feedstocks to meet biomass demand for biofuels, bioenergy, and specialized bioproducts, such as industrial compounds and biomaterial precursors. Most bioeconomy projections assume the widespread deployment of novel feedstocks developed through the use of modern molecular breeding techniques, but rarely consider the challenges involved with the use of genetically modified crops, which can include hurdles due to regulatory approvals, market adoption, and public acceptance. In this paper we consider the implications of various transgenic crops and traits under development for the bioeconomy that highlight these challenges. We believe that an awareness of the issues in crop and trait selection will allow developers to design crops with maximum stakeholder appeal and with the greatest potential for widespread adoption, while avoiding applications unlikely to meet regulatory approval or gain market and public acceptance.

TI Inherent antibacterial activity of a peptide-based beta-hairpin hydrogel
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Among several important considerations for implantation of a biomaterial, a main concern is the introduction of infection. We have designed a hydrogel scaffold from the self-assembling peptide, MAX1, for tissue regeneration applications whose surface exhibits inherent antibacterial activity. In experiments where MAX1 gels are challenged with bacterial solutions ranging in concentrations from 2 x 10(3) colony forming units (CFUs)/dm(2) to 2 x 10(9) CFUs/dm(2), gel surfaces exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Results show that the hydrogel surface is active against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) bacteria, all prevalent in hospital settings. Live-dead assays employing laser scanning confocal microscopy show that bacteria are killed when they engage the surface. In addition, the surface of MAX1 hydrogels was shown to cause inner and outer membrane disruption in experiments that monitor the release of beta-galactosidase from the cytoplasm of lactose permease-deficient E. coli ML-35. These data suggest a mechanism of antibacterial action that involves membrane disruption that leads to cell death upon cellular contact with the gel surface. Although the hydrogel surface exhibits bactericidal activity, co-culture experiments indicate hydrogel surfaces show selective toxicity to bacterial versus mammalian cells. Additionally, gel surfaces are nonhemolytic toward human erythrocytes, which maintain healthy morphologies when in contact with the surface. These material attributes make MAX1 gels attractive candidates for use in tissue regeneration, even in nonsterile environments.

AB Bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is a promising biomaterial for broad potential applications in optical and optoelectronic devices. Upon the original photochemical cycle of bR, for the first time we construct a hybrid bR/quantum dot (QD) bionanosystem and a stationary current is generated from the modified photocycle. We propose a model to explain that QDs could act as nanoscaled light sources embedded in bR to assist its generation of a stationary photocurrent, which is completely different from the reported transient spikes from the bR's photocycle. It opens the horizon for optical devices other than those reported up to date. (C) 2007 American Institute of Physics.

TI Supramolecular biomaterials. A modular approach towards tissue
   engineering
SO BULLETIN OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB Supramolecular chemistry is an exciting area of science that plays a central role in bringing different disciplines together, ranging from molecular medicine to nanotechnology. Materials science based on supramolecular interactions is an emerging field, which has made important steps forward in the past ten years. The self-assembly of small synthetic molecules into long-chain architectures gives rise to the careful design of supramolecular polymers or fibers based on highly directional, reversible, non-covalent interactions. Much afford is put into the development of supramolecular (polymeric) materials with true materials properties, both in solution and in the solid state. These supramolecular materials are beginning to reach the market in all kind of applications. The field of regenerative medicine in general and that of tissue engineering in particular is one of the most challenging areas in which supramolecular materials might have a high potential. In tissue engineering, the biological environment and the interactions of cells with the artificial biomaterial is of utmost importance for the functioning of the implant, i.e. the engineered tissue. Ideal biomaterials do not only have to fulfil the biomaterials trinity of tuneable mechanical properties, regulation of the degradability and the ease for bioactivity incorporation, but also have to mimic the natural environment where the materials are brought into. Therefore, a modular, self-assembly approach using several supramolecular building blocks is an exquisite way to produce such "responsive" biomaterials. It is proposed that the artificial materials described in this account have the same type of dynamic ability to adapt its biofunctionality as is so well known for the living cells in the host tissue. This account will highlight two systems, i.e. self-assembling oligopeptide fibers as pioneered by Stupp et al. and Zhang et al., and our hydrogen-bonded supramolecular polymers, to show the potential of a modular approach to dynamic biomaterials for tissue engineering.

TI Surface modification and property analysis of biomedical polymers used
   for tissue engineering
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES B-BIOINTERFACES
AB The response of host organism in macroscopic, cellular and protein levels to biomaterials is, in most cases, closely associated with the materials' surface properties. In tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and many other biomedical fields, surface engineering of the bio-inert synthetic polymers is often required to introduce bioactive species that can promote cell adhesion, proliferation, viability and enhanced ECM-secretion functions. Up to present, a large number of surface engineering techniques for improving biocompatibility have been well established, the work of which generally contains three main steps: (1) surface modification of the polymeric materials; (2) chemical and physical characterizations; and (3) biocompatibility assessment through cell culture. This review focuses on the principles and practices of surface engineering of biomedical polymers with regards to particular aspects depending on the authors' research background and opinions. The review starts with an introduction of principles in designing polymeric biomaterial surfaces, followed by introduction of surface modification techniques to improve hydrophilicity, to introduce reactive functional groups and to immobilize functional protein molecules. The chemical and physical characterizations of the modified biomaterials are then discussed with emphasis on several important issues such as surface functional group density, functional layer thickness, protein surface density and bioactivity. Three most commonly used surface composition characterization techniques, i.e. ATR-FTIR, XPS, SIMS, are compared in terms of their penetration depth. Ellipsometry, CD, EPR, SPR and QCM's principles and applications in analyzing surface proteins are introduced. Finally discussed are frequently applied methods and their principles to evaluate biocompatibility of biomaterials via cell culture. In this section, current techniques and their developments to measure cell adhesion, proliferation, morphology, viability, migration and gene expression are reviewed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

TI Fabrication and characteristics of hydroxyapatite reinforced
   polypropylene as a bone analogue biomaterial
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB Composite biomaterials, which consist of a polymer matrix and a particulate bioactive phase and are hence analogous to bone microstructure, have been developed for human hard tissue substitution. In this investigation, a manufacturing route employing injection moulding was established for producing bone analogue biomaterials. Using this manufacturing technology, a potential bone replacement material, hydroxyapatite (HA) reinforced polypropylene (PP) composite (HA/PP), was made, with the HA volume percentage being up to 25%. The characteristics of the HA/PP composite were studied using various techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), tensile testing, microhardness testing, and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). It was demonstrated that with the use of the established manufacturing route, HA particles were well dispersed and homogeneously distributed in the PP matrix. Properties of the composite were affected by the amount of HA incorporated in the composite. The melting temperature and crystallisation temperature of the composite were slightly affected by the addition of HA particles, and the crystallinity of the PP matrix polymer was decreased with an increase in HA content. Young's modulus, microhardness, and storage modulus increased when the HA volume percentage was increased from 10 to 25%, with corresponding decreases in tensile strength, elongation at fracture and loss tangent.

TI Adsorption and viscoelastic properties of fractionated mucin (BSM) and
   bovine serum albumin (BSA) studied with quartz crystal microbalance
   (QCM-D)
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB The adsorption profile and viscoelastic properties of bovine submaxillary gland mucin (BSM) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), extracted from a commercial mucin preparation, adsorbing to polystyrene surfaces has been studied using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). A significant difference in the adsorption properties of the different proteins was detected; with the BSA adsorbing in a flat rigid layer whilst the mucin adsorbed in a diffuse, highly viscoelastic layer. Subsequent addition of BSA to the preadsorbed mucin layer resulted in stiffening of the protein layer which was attributed to complexation of the mucin by BSA. In contrast, a preadsorbed layer of BSA prevented mucin adsorption altogether. Combined mixtures of mucin and BSA in well defined ratios revealed intermediate properties between the two separate protein species which varied systematically with the protein ratios. The results shed light on the synergistic effects of complexation of lower molecular weight biomolecular species with mucin. The possibility to selectively control protein uptake and tailor the physical properties of the adsorbed layer makes mucin an attractive option for application in biomaterial coatings.

TI Acetone and ethanol solid-state gas sensors based on TiO2 nanoparticles
   thin film deposited by matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB Matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE) is a new promising laser-based technique thought for polymer or biomaterial thin films deposition. In this work, the MAPLE technique has been used for the deposition of titania (TiO2) nanoparticle thin films to be used for gas sensor applications. For this purpose, an aqueous solution of TiO2 nanoparticles, synthesized by a novel chemical route, was frozen at the liquid nitrogen temperature and introduced in a vacuum chamber to be irradiated with a pulsed ArF excimer laser. The volatile solvent was pumped away while the TiO2 nanoparticles were deposited on Si and Al2O3 substrates. A uniform distribution of TiO2 nanoparticles with an average size of about 10 nut was obtained, as demonstrated by high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM-FEG) inspection. We realized gas-sensing devices based on resistive transduction mechanism by using the TiO2 nanoparticles thin films deposited by the MAPLE technique onto suitable rough alumina substrates equipped with interdigitated electrical contacts (IDC) and heating elements. Electrical characterization measurements were carried out in controlled environment. The results of the gas-sensing tests towards low concentrations of ethanol and acetone vapors are reported. Typical gas sensor parameters (gas responses, response/recovery time, sensitivity, and low detection limit) towards ethanol were extracted and compared with to the corresponding parameters towards acetone.

TI The oil-absorbing property of polyhydroxyalkanoate films and its
   practical application: A refreshing new outlook for an old degrading
   material
SO MACROMOLECULAR BIOSCIENCE
AB Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have attracted the attention of academia and industry because of their plastic-like properties and biodegradability. However, practical applications as a commodity material have not materialized because of their high production cost and unsatisfactory mechanical properties. PHAs are also believed to have high-value applications as an absorbable biomaterial for tissue engineering and drug-delivery devices because of their biocompatibility. However, research in these areas is still in its very early stages. The main problem faced by proponents of PHAs is the lack of a niche area where PHAs will be the most desired material in terms of its function during use rather than because of its eco-friendly virtues after use. Here, we report on the oil-absorbing property of PHA films and its potential applications. By comparing with some of the existing commercial products, the potential application of PHAs as cosmetic oil-blotting films is revealed for the first time. Besides having the ability to rapidly absorb and retain oil, PHA films also have a natural oil-indicator property, showing obvious changes in opacity following oil absorption. Surface analysis revealed that the surface structures such as porosity and smoothness exert great influence on the rapid oil-absorption properties of the PHA films. These newly discovered properties could be exploited to create a niche area for the practical applications of PHAs.

   phosphate coated with poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide)
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB Calcium phosphate/poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (CP/DLPLG) composite biomaterial, in which each CP particle was coated with DLPLG, was synthesized. Two kinds of composites were prepared: microcomposite, with particles 150-200 pin in size, and nanocomposite, with the particles 40 +/- 5 mn in size. Using nanoparticles, a new class of injectible composite biomaterials was produced. Based on scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, differential thermal analysis, thermogravinietric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared analyses, the structure and phase organization in both biomaterials was identified and in both studied cases CP particles were coated with DLPLG polymer. An injectable composite biomaterial, the characteristics of which depend on the ratio of the phases, was prepared by mixing physiological solution with the nano-CP/DLPLG composite. Rheological studies indicated a possible agglomeration of particles of the injectable nano-CP/DLPLG composite biomaterial with a CP content of 65%. (C) 2007 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Self-setting properties and in vitro bioactivity of calcium sulfate
   hemihydrate-tricalcium silicate composite bone cements
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB Self-setting biomaterials are widely used for tissue repair and regeneration. Calcium sulfate hemihydrate has been used for many years as a self-setting biomaterial due to its good setting properties. However, too fast a degradation rate and lack of bioactivity have limited its application in orthopaedic field. Herein, tricalcium silicate was introduced into calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CaSO4 center dot 1/2H(2)O) to form a calcium sulfate hemihydrate-based composite, and its behavior as a cement was studied in comparison with pure calcium sulfate hemihydrate. The results indicated that the workability and setting time of the composite pastes are higher than those of pure CaSO4 center dot 1/2H(2)O, and the composite pastes showed much better short- and long-term mechanical properties than those of pure CaSO4 center dot 1/2H(2)O. Moreover, the biphasic specimens showed significantly improved bioactivity and degradability compared with those of pure CaSO4 center dot 1/2H(2)O, indicating that the composite cements might have a significant clinical advantage over the traditional CaSO4 center dot 1/2H(2)O cement.

SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB Several materials were evaluated for potential use in a bioreactor system for a tissue-engineered cornea. Two types of cytotoxicity tests were performed using human corneal stromal fibroblasts: a 24 h cytotoxicity test based on the ASTM standard F813-01 and a 7 days growth inhibition test. It was determined that culture configuration, autoclaving and materials surface preparation were all important factors influencing cell viability. Poly(etheretherketone) and titanium-6Al-4V were found to be the most appropriate materials for use in a corneal bioreactor system. Furthermore, poly(oxymethylene) copolymer and poly(tetrafluoroethlylene) are not safe for use with human corneal fibroblasts after autoclaving. (C) 2007 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Use of a genetically engineered protein for the design of a multivalent
   MR1 contrast agent
SO BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY
AB The majority of clinically used contrast agents (CAs) for magnetic resonance imaging have low relaxivities and thus require high concentrations for signal enhancement. Research has turned to multivalent, macromolecular CAs to increase CA efficiency. However, previously developed macromolecular CAs do not provide high relaxivities, have limited biocompatibility, and/or do not have a structure that is readily modifiable to tailor to particular applications. We report a new family of multivalent, biomacromolecular, genetically engineered protein polymer-based CAs; the protein backbone contains evenly spaced lysines that are derivatized with gadolinium (Gd(III)) chelators. The protein's length and repeating amino acid sequence are genetically specified. We reproducibly obtained conjugates with an average of 8-9 Gd(III) chelators per protein. These multivalent CAs reproducibly provide a high relaxivity of 7.3 mM(-1) s(-1) per Gd(III) and 62.6 mM(-1) s(-1) per molecule. Furthermore, they can be incorporated into biomaterial hydrogels via chemical cross-linking of the remaining free lysines, and provide a dramatic contrast enhancement. Thus, these protein polymer CAs could be a useful tool for following the evolution of tissue engineering scaffolds.

TI Monitoring of titanium base alloys-biofluids interface
SO BIOELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB Monitoring of the titanium, Ti-5AI-4V, Ti-6Al-4Fe implant materials - Ringer I and Ringer 2 solutions (of different pH values) interface for long term was studied in this work. In Ringer I solution (with high chloride ion content) all biomaterials present self-passivation. On Ti-6Al-4Fe alloy, the breakdown of the passive film was registered but at high pitting potential; pitting protection potential is very noble and can not be reached in human fluids. In Ringer 2 solution was obtained more electropositive corrosion potential values than in Ringer I solution; pitting corrosion of Ti-6Al-4Fe alloy is characterised by nobler breakdown and pitting protection potential values, therefore a better pitting corrosion resistance and tendency. Ion release increases in time, for the first 400-600 immersion hours and then tend to a constant level with very low values, non-dangerous for human body. All open circuit potentials oscillate around some electropositive values. The potential gradients calculated for extreme pH values have low values during 20000 exposure hours and can not accelerate the corrosion. Atomic Force Microscopy images obtained after different exposure periods in Ringer I solution revealed that the roughness increased in time, suggesting a dynamic process at biomaterial-biofluid interface. X-ray Photoelectron spectra obtained after 2880 immersion hours in Ringer 2 solution show the existence of protective titanium dioxide TiO2 and TiO and Ti2O3 oxides both for titanium and Ti-5AI-4V alloy. Also, Al2O3 oxide was detected. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Influence of substratum surface chemistry/energy and topography on the
   human fetal osteoblastic cell line hFOB 1.19: Phenotypic and genotypic
   responses observed in vitro
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Time-dependent phenotypic response of a model osteoblast cell line (hFOB 1.19, ATCC, and CRL-11372) to substrata with varying surface chemistry and topography is reviewed within the context of extant cell-adhesion theory. Cell-attachment and proliferation kinetics are compared using morphology as a leading indicator of cell phenotype. Expression of (alpha(2), alpha(3), alpha(4), alpha(5), alpha(v), beta(1), and beta(3)) integrins, vinculin, as well as secretion of osteopontin (OP) and type I collagen (Col I) supplement this visual assessment of hFOB growth. It is concluded that significant cell-adhesion events-contact, attachment, spreading, and proliferation-are similar on all surfaces, independent of substratum surface chemistry/energy. However, this sequence of events is significantly delayed and attenuated on hydrophobic (poorly water-wettable) surfaces exhibiting characteristically low-attachment efficiency and long induction periods before cells engage in an exponential-growth phase. Results suggest that a 'time-cell-substratum-compatibility-superposition principle' is at work wherein similar bioadhesive outcomes can be ultimately achieved on all surface types with varying hydrophilicity, but the time required to arrive at this outcome increases with decreasing cell-substratum-compatibility. Genomic and proteomic tools offer unprecedented opportunity to directly measure changes in the cellular machinery that lead to observed cell responses to different materials. But for the purpose of measuring structure-property relationships that can guide biomaterial development, genomic/proteomic tools should be applied early in the adhesion/spreading process before cells have an opportunity to significantly remodel the cell-substratum interface, effectively erasing cause and effect relationships between cell-substratum-compatibility and substratum properties.
   Impact Statement: This review quantifies relationships among cell phenotype, substratum surface chemistry/energy, topography, and cell-Substratum contact time for the model osteoblast cell line hFOB 1.19, revealing that genomic/proteomic tools are most useful in the pursuit of understanding cell adhesion if applied early in the adhesion/spreading process.

TI A comparative evaluation of poly-L-lysine-palmitic acid and
   Lipofectamine (TM) 2000 for plasmid delivery to bone marrow stromal
   cells
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The Current study compared the effectiveness of an amphiphilic biomaterial poly(L-lysine)-palmitic acid (PLL-PA), and the lipid-based transfection agent Lipofectamine (TM) 2000 for plasmid delivery to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). We investigated the utility of the carriers to deliver a plasmid containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFP) to BMSC in vitro. Confocal microscopy was used to investigate the intracellular trafficking of pEGFP/carrier complexes. pEGFP delivery and EGFP expression were assessed by flow cytometry. PLL-PA formed condensed structures with pEGFP and successfully delivered the plasmid into the nucleus within 5h of incubation with the cells. PLL-PA delivered the pEGFP to similar to 80% of the cells, achieving a maximum transfection efficiency of similar to 22%. This was significantly higher than Lipofectamine (TM) 2000-mediated transfection, which was 11% under most optimal conditions. Dosing the BMSC two or three times during the 24h period increased the transfection efficiency by 2-3 folds, without compromising cell viability. When chloroquine was employed as an ensomolytic agent, 100 mu M of the drug increased the transfection efficiency while reducing cell viability, but lower concentrations (1-10 mu M) were not beneficial for transfection. Combining PLL-PA with Lipofectamine (TM) 2000 created an additive effect, increasing the transfection efficiency of PLL-PA. Long-term evaluation of gene expression with pEGFP/PLL-PA yielded similar to 17% transfection on day 1, which gradually decreased over a 12-day period. We conclude that PLL-PA is an effective biomaterial carrier and a promising candidate for non-viral gene delivery to BMSC. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The effect of molecules in mother-of-pearl on the decrease in bone
   resorption through the inhibition of osteoclast cathepsin K
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB This study evaluates the effect of the mother-of-pearl (nacre) organic matrix on mammalian osteoclast activity and on cathepsin K protease. Rabbit osteoclasts were cultured on bovine cortical bone slices in the presence of water-soluble molecules extracted from nacre of the pearl oyster Pinctada maryaritifera. Osteoclast resorption activity was determined by quantification of the resorption surface area on bovine bone slices. Papain and cathepsin K, B and L inhibition tests were performed in the presence of the nacre water-soluble extracts. The active crude extract was fractionated by dialysis and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography before electrospray mass spectrometry analysis of inhibitory fractions. The water-soluble molecules extracted from nacre decreased bone resorption without jeopardizing osteoclast survival. The hydrolytic activity of cysteine proteinases was reduced when the enzymes were incubated with the nacre water-soluble molecules. Trending towards characterization of the molecules involved, it appears that cathepsin K inhibitors remain in different nacre water-soluble organic matrix subfractions, composed of low molecular weight molecules. Mollusk shell nacre contains molecules capable of reducing osteoclast bone resorption activity by inhibiting cathepsin K, giving a new facet of the bioactivity of nacre as bone biomaterial.

AB Adhesion and spreading of cells on biomaterials are integrin-mediated processes. But recent findings indicate a key role of the cell membrane associated matrix substance hyaluronan (HA) in interface interactions. Because HA is a negatively charged molecule we assume that a biomaterial surface with an opposed charge could boost the first contact of the cell to the surface. Polished cp titanium(R-a = 0.19 mu m) was coated with an amino-group containing plasma polymer (Ti PPA). For this purpose, a microwave excited, pulsed, low-pressure plasma was used. Additionally, collagen was immobilized on Ti PPA with polyethylene glycol diacid (PEG-DA), catalyzed by carbodiimide (M). The physico-chemical surface analytical techniques like XPS, FT-IR, water contact angle and zeta-potential verified the retention of the allylamine precursor structure. Human osteoblasts were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM). Adhesion and cell cycle phases were calculated by flow cytometry. Spreading and actin cytoskeleton were visualized by confocal microscopy. Gene expression of osteogenic markers was detected by real-time RT-PCR. Ti PPA is significantly advantageous concerning initial adhesion and spreading during the first hours of the cell contact to the surface. The proliferation of osteoblasts is positively influenced. Gene expression of the differentiation marker bone sialoprotein was upregulated after 24 h.
   Our results demonstrate that functionalization of titanium with positively charged amino-groups is sufficiently enough to significantly improve initial steps of the cellular contact to the material surface. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to graft RGD peptides with well controlled densities onto poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film surfaces. Biomimetic modifications were performed by means of a four-step reaction procedure: surface modification in order to create -COOH groups onto polymer surface, coupling agent grafting and finally immobilization of peptides. The originality of this work is to evaluate several grafted densities peptides. Toluidine blue and high-resolution mu-imager (using [H-3]-Lys) were used to evaluate densities. Moreover, mu-imager has exhibited the stability of peptides grafted onto the surface when treated under harsh conditions. Benefits of the as-proposed method were related to the different concentrations of peptides grafted onto the surface as well as the capacity of RGD peptide to interact with integrin receptors.

AB Cell adhesion on a biomaterial is an important phase of the cell-material interactions and the quality of this phase governs the success of the biomaterial integration. Understanding of the phenomena of cell adhesion and in particular understanding of cell adhesion on biomaterials is of crucial importance for the development of new biomaterials with excellent biocompatibility. One of the physical quantitative indexes to evaluate the quality of cell-material adhesion is its strength. Determining the strength of adhesive bonds requires applying external forces to the cells. Thus, a few methods have been developed to evaluate the strength of cell-material adhesion (micropipette, microplates, microcantilever,...). These methods apply shear forces on adherent cells.
   The aim of our work is the development of a new ultrasonic characterization method of cellular adhesion on substrates. With our method, longitudinal acoustic waves are applied on cell culture to impose a longitudinal strain on cells. Only the cells subjected to a sufficient level of strain will be detached from the substrate. The idea is to correlate cell detachment rate to the longitudinal strain threshold supported by cells. From this result, we can deduce the critical force just sufficient to detach the cell. This global method can be adapted for different cell types and for different substrates. This method can provide an evaluation of the effect of functionalization on substrates. The technique is investigated for the 200 kHz ultrasound frequency. An insonificator adapted to the use of cell culture boxes was developed and calibrated. Tests were carried out on a glass substrate with or without biological conditioning. We used the MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cell line. Our results to date provide the value of the necessary force to detach with reproducibility osteoblastic cells from glass. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB For mathematical modelling of the biomaterial-cell contact, it is necessary to find both parameters characterizing physical and chemical properties of the material surface and also such describing the reaction of the adhering cells. Only those material and cell parameters that correlate with each other are applicable to model this contact mathematically. Only few papers are dealing with this special problem.
   The aim of this paper is to present results of physical/chemical and biological investigations made on differently modified rough titanium implant surfaces in order to find out only the correlating parameters. Furthermore we discuss several ways to apply statistical methods to the correlation problem.
   Only few ones of all investigated parameters both on material and on cellular side were applicable for correlation. For example we found in our studies that fractal structure parameter topothesy has influence on the spreading behaviour of the osteoblastic cells. However the value of the correlation coefficient and its statistical significance heavily depend on the method of averaging the available data. Especially the biological data (spreading area) were afflicted with relatively high error up to 30%. Averaging of this data masks the true facts. That is why the correlation coefficient considerably decreases if the biological parameters are not averaged. On the other hand, the statistical reliability increases due to the higher number of investigated cases.
   Critical error discussion is necessary in statistical correlation between material and biological parameters. Often the results are heavily influenced by the statistical handling of data, especially if only few data are available. May be that new unconventional methods like bootstrap method can show a way out of this dilemma. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Divalent cations like Mn2+ are known to strongly influence the integrin affinity to ligands and - in consequence - cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. Therefore, divalent cation supplementation of biomaterials could be a promising approach to improve the ingrowth and the integration of implants. We were interested, whether manganese ions affect cellular functions like spreading, proliferation as well as gene expression in human osteoblasts. MG-63 osteoblastic cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS. MnCl2 was added at a concentration range of 0.01-0.5 mM for 24 h and 48 It. Spreading (cell area in mu m(2)) of PKH26-stainedcells (cell membrane dye) was analyzed using confocal microscopy. Cell proliferation was measured by flow cytometry. Quantification of the phosphorylation status of signaling proteins was estimated using the Bio-Plex 200 system. Gene expression of osteogenic markers at the mRNA and protein level was analyzed by quantitative real time RTPCR and Western blot, respectively. The results demonstrated that at higher concentrations of Mn2+ cells revealed a spindle shaped morphology. Further analyses indicated a reduced spreading, proliferation as well as phosphorylation of signaling proteins due to the influence of Mn2+, in a concentration-dependent manner. Although expression of bone sialo protein (BSP) at the mRNA level increased both after 24 h and 48 h in the presence of manganese, no increased expression of BSP was detected at the protein level. The expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and colla en I (Col 1) mRNA decreased at >0.1 mM MnCl2. We speculate that the effect of manganese cations on cell functions is strongly 9 concentration-dependent and the release of manganese when incorporated in a biomaterial surface has to be thoroughly adjusted.

TI Batch removal of chromium(VI) from aqueous solution by Turkish brown
   coals
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB The ability of using low-rank Turkish brown coals (Ilgin: BC1, Bey ehir: BC2, and Ermenek: BC3) to remove Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions was studied as a function of contact time, solution pH, temperature, concentration of metal solutions and amount of adsorbent. Their sorption properties were compared with the activated carbon from Chemviron (AQ-30). Adsorption of Cr(VI) uptake is in all cases pH-dependent showing a maximum at equilibrium pH values between 2.0 and 3.2, depending on the biomaterial, that correspond to initial pH values of 2.3 units for BC1, 3.0 units for BC2 and 3.2 units for BC3 and AQ-30. Batch equilibrium tests showed that the Cr(VI) removal was fitted with Freundlich isotherm and the adsorption reached equilibrium in 80 min. It was proceeding effectively into a short acid pH interval (2.0-3.2) where processes of Cr(VI) sorption are maximized. It was observed that the maximum adsorption capacity of 11.2 mM of Cr(VI)/g for Ilgin (BC1), 12.4 mM of Cr(VI)/g for Beysehir (BC2), 7.4 mM of Cr(VI)/g for Ermenek (BC3) and 6.8 mM of Cr(VI)/g for activated carbon (AQ-30) was achieved at pH of 3.0. The rise in temperature caused a slight decrease in the value of the equilibrium constant (K-c) for the sorption of Cr(VI) ion. The Cr(VI) sorption capacities of Bey ehir and Ilgin brown coals were the same. Ermenek brown coals and activated carbon (AQ-30) showed a similar sorption capacity. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Oestrogen-induced changes in biomechanics in the cornea as a possible
   reason for keratectasia
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Aim: The risk of regression after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and the tendency to develop keratectasia after laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis ( LASIK) procedure is higher in women than men. Currently, interest is focused on the influence of oestrogen on corneal stability after corneal refractive surgery. The aim of this experimental study was to investigate the change in biomechanical properties of the cornea induced by oestrogen.
   Methods: The influence of oestrogen was investigated in 12 fresh porcine corneas incubated in culture medium with 10 mu mol/I beta-oestradiol for 7 days. A group of 12 porcine corneas incubated in culture medium without oestradiol for the same time served as a control group. Strips of cornea were cut and the stress-strain was measured in a biomaterial tester. The Young's modulus was calculated.
   Results: During incubation the thickness of the cornea changed in the control group by only 6.4% and in the oestradiol group by 12%. However, the difference in the biomechanical stress values at 10% strain was significantly larger. In the control group the stress value was 120.18 +/- 28.93 kPa and in the oestradiol group 76.87 +/- 34.63 kPa (p = 0.002), representing a reduction of the corneal stiffness by 36% due to the oestradiol treatment.
   Conclusion: Oestrogen is a modulating factor of the biomechanical properties of the cornea that is not explainable only by an increased swelling. The significance of the hormone status of patients and its influence on the biomechanical stability of the cornea, a determining factor after refractive surgery, have been underestimated and may contribute to the development of keratectasia.

TI Initial osteoblast-like cell response to pure titanium and
   zirconia/alumina ceramics
SO DENTAL MATERIALS
AB Objectives. Outstanding mechanical properties, resistance to scratching and high biocompatibility make zirconia/alumina ceramics interesting for dental applications. To solve the problem of the well-known low temperature degradation and to provide stable mechanical properties a novel zirconia alloy ((Y,Nb)-TZP/alumina) was developed. The aim of this study was to investigate the initial bone cell response to this new zirconia/alumina composite ceramic.
   Methods. HOS cells were cultured on zirconia/alumina composite (Zc) and pure titanium (Ti) discs. Surface topography was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM), cell morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cell proliferation (MTS) and alkaline phosphatase activity was measured at 1, 4 and 8 days. The mRNA expression of Cycline D1, the cell cycle regulating gene, integrin P 1, osteonectin (ON) and P-actin were evaluated by RT-PCR analysis after 12, 24 and 48 h.
   Results. Both substrates showed a very smooth character with R.-values in the range of 0.002-0.113 mu m supporting a continuous cellular growth. After 8 days, cell proliferation on Zc was higher than onTi. The mRNA expression of cyclin D1 showed similar activity after 48 h on both surfaces, ALP activity was higher on Zc after 8 days. ON expression however showed no difference between the two groups.
   Significance. Our data demonstrate that this new zirconia composite ceramic showed at least equivalent or slightly better biological response of osteoblast-like HOS cells than pure titanium during a short-time cell culture period.

TI Cytotoxicity of resin composites as a function of interface area
SO DENTAL MATERIALS
AB Objectives. The standardization protocols for biomaterial cytotoxicity testing require fine tuning for oral biomaterials to obtain international comparability as the basis for risk assessment. The principal aims were specifically to evaluate the effect of (i) relative interface area (ratio of specimen surface to cell layer surface) and (ii) volume of cell culture medium on cytotoxicity as a potential modification of ISO 10993-5.
   Methods. ISO 10993-5 was followed with an interface area of 12.5%, as recommended, using primary human gingival fibroblasts and L-929 mouse fibroblasts. in another series of experiments (using L-929 cells) the interface area was varied between 12.5% and 0.71%. For each relative interface area, three conditions for affecting the cure of the resin composite were investigated by using three mould materials: white, transparent and black moulds. in addition, the volume of cell culture medium was varied.
   Composite specimens (Herculite XRV) were added to the cultures immediately after production or preincubation for 1, 2, 7 days or 6 weeks under cell culture conditions. Specimens were incubated with fibroblasts for 72 h and cell numbers determined by flow cytometry. Glass specimens resembling composite specimens in diameter and height were used as negative controls.
   Results. Cytotoxicity results with primary gingival fibroblasts were comparable to results with the cell line L-929. An effect from the color/material of the specimen moulds was found. Different ratios of specimen sizes to cell culture parameters (cell layer surface, volume of cell culture medium) produced different results. Three out of four differently designed specimens showed the same behavior in cell culture. Significance. Cytotoxicity tests should be further standardized in line with existing standards with regard to specimen production protocols to ensure results are internationally comparable to validate these tests as tools for risk assessment.

TI Cell adhesion and proliferation patterns on mixed self-assembled
   monolayers carrying various ratios of hydroxyl and methyl groups
SO DENTAL MATERIALS JOURNAL
AB Mixed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with hydroxyl and methyl surface groups were prepared as biomaterial surface models which were well-controlled and well-defined. The surface properties of mixed SAMs were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and water contact angle measurement. It was found that the parameter of water contact angle more accurately reflected the surface compositions of mixed SAMs than by the mixing ratio of the two alkanethiols. Cell adhesion and growth were also examined on mixed SAMs of various wettability conditions. It was found that amount of serum protein adsorption changed with the surface composition. To examine the effect of surface composition on cell growth pattern, four cell types - C3H10T1/2-clone 8, L929, UVB6-2.1A, and MC3T3E1 - were incubated on mixed SAMs for three or six days. Differences in cell growth pattern against wettability were clearly recognized for each cell type. In light of the results obtained in this study, the relationship between the biocompatibility of biomaterials and surface factors were thus clarified.

TI Evolving therapy for fecal incontinence
SO DISEASES OF THE COLON & RECTUM
AB Background: Fecal incontinence is common and can be socially debilitating. Nonoperative management of fecal incontinence includes dietary modification, antidiarrheal medication, and biofeedback. The traditional surgical approach is sphincteroplasty if there is a defect of the external sphincter. Innovative treatment modalities have included sacral nerve stimulation, injectable implants, dynamic graciloplasty, and artificial bowel sphincter.
   Discussion: This review was designed to assess the various surgical options available for fecal incontinence and critically evaluate the evidence behind these procedures. The algorithm in the surgical treatment of fecal incontinence is shifting. Injectable therapy and sacral nerve stimulation are likely to be the mainstay in future treatment of moderate and severe fecal incontinence, respectively. Sphincteroplasty is limited to a small group of patients with isolated defect of the external sphincter. A stoma, although effective, can be avoided in most cases.

TI Analysis of in vitro reaction layers formed on 48S4 glass for
   applications in biomaterial field
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The purpose of this work is to study the formation of hydroxyapatite (Ca-10 (PO4)(6)(OH)(2)) on the surface of glass 48S4 with chemical composition: SiO2: 48%, CaO: 30%, Na2O: 18% and P2O5: 4% in weight ratio. This selected composition presents phosphorus contributions lower than that in Bioglass((R)) [ 1] developed by L. Hench. Comparison of the kinetic formation of hydroxyapatite on the glass surfaces of these two biomaterials was made. The Material was prepared by melting and rapid quenching. It shows a bioactive character. This phenomenon is confirmed by the '' in vitro '' formation of hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA) layer on the surface of glass after immersion in the Simulated Body Fluid (SBF). Before immersion in SBF, The proposed composition of glass was analyzed using several physicochemical methods like XRD, FTIR, SEM, and EDS confirming the composition and its amorphous state well. The pellets were soaked in SBF for 2 h, 1, 3, 7 and 15 days at 37 degrees C. The analyses of SBF after each immersion time were carried out using ICP-OES method. Results show important exchanges of ions between the surface of glass and the SBF. They revealed the formation of an amorphous CaO-P2O5- rich layer on the surface of the specimens after 1 day in the solution and a crystalline HCAlayer after 3 days immersion time as will be shown by XRD, EDS and FTIR analysis. The cristallinity increases with immersion time. After 15 days immersion in SBF liquid, the specimens are still fully covered by hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA) layer.

TI Porous silk scaffolds can be used for tissue engineering annulus
   fibrosus
SO EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL
AB There is no optimal treatment for symptomatic degenerative disc disease which affects millions of people worldwide. One novel approach would be to form a patch or tissue replacement to repair the annulus fibrosus (AF) through which the NP herniates. As the optimal scaffold for this has not been defined the purpose of this study was to determine if porous silk scaffolds would support AF cell attachment and extracellular matrix accumulation and whether chemically decorating the scaffold with RGD peptide, which has been shown to enhance attachment for other cell types, would further improve AF cell attachment and tissue formation. Annulus fibrosus cells were isolated from bovine caudal discs and seeded into porous silk scaffolds. The percent cell attachment was quantified and the cell morphology and distribution within the scaffold was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. The cell-seeded scaffolds were grown for up to 8 weeks and evaluated for gene expression, histological appearance and matrix accumulation. AF cells attach to porous silk scaffolds, proliferate and synthesize and accumulate extracellular matrix as demonstrated biochemically and histologically. Coupling the silk scaffold with RGD-peptides did not enhance cell attachment nor tissue formation but did affect cell morphology. As well, the cells had higher levels of type II collagen and aggrecan gene expression when compared to cells grown on the non-modified scaffold, a feature more in keeping with cells of the inner annulus. Porous silk is an appropriate scaffold on which to grow AF cells. Coupling RGD peptide to the scaffold appears to influence AF cell phenotype suggesting that it may be possible to select an appropriate scaffold that favours inner annulus versus outer annulus differentiation which will be important for tissue engineering an intervertebral disc.

TI Blends of L-tyrosine based polyurethanes for biomaterial applications
SO EXPRESS POLYMER LETTERS
AB Three polyurethane blends were made from segmented polyurethanes synthesized from desaminotyrosyl tyrosine hexyl ester (DTH), an L-tyrosine based diphenolic dipeptide, as chain extender. The soft segment of these polyurethanes is either polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polycaprolactone diol (PCL) and the diisocyanate is hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI). The blends were developed to investigate the effect of varying composition on the overall physical, thermal, mechanical, surface and degradation properties of the material. The characterization results show that the properties of these blended materials can be controlled by adjusting the composition. Blends with increased PEG based polyurethane exhibited more water absorption and higher degradation characteristics. With increasing PCL based polyurethane, the mechanical properties of the blends were improved although the blends were relatively more amorphous in nature. The L-tyrosine based polyurethane blends hold the potential for use in different biomaterial applications.

TI Thermal management of biomaterials in a rectangular cavity surrounded by
   a phase change material
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ADVANCED PACKAGING
AB The shipping of live biological materials requires very close monitoring and perhaps active control of the temperature of the materials. This paper presents the results of a numerical study of 2-D transient natural convection inside a rectangular cavity. The cavity is intended to simulate a typical biological shipping container in which the biomaterials are encased in a chamber surrounded by a phase change material. The rectangular cavity is filled with air (Pr approximate to 0.69). Initially, the air is at uniform temperature and zero velocity. The top and side walls of the rectangular cavity are fixed at a low temperature and the bottom wall is coupled to the top wall of the heated solid block. For the lower solid block, the side and bottom wall are assumed adiabatic and filled with solid biomaterials. The biomaterial is subjected to a step heat input at time zero. A finite volume approach is used to solve the generic transport equations with the Boussinesq approximation. The flow inside the rectangular cavity is divided into three transient regimes: 1) initial transient stage; 2) quasi-steady stage; and 3) late quasi-steady stage. The results of the parametric study are included for shallow cavities, Ar = 0.5, Ar = 0.25, Ar = 0.125. The transient regimes and fluid flow structure were found to be functions of Rayleigh number, aspect ratio, Prandtl number, thermal capacity parameter (Q*), and nondimensional time (t*).

In the present work, barley straw demonstrated the higher water uptake and the higher molar ratio of water to ethanol uptake compared to the wheat straw and crab shells. Important factors affecting water adsorption including particle size of barley straw, water concentration and contact time were examined. The water adsorption isotherm was well simulated by Toth equation. The results showed that the barley straw is a potential biomaterial for removing water from ethanol-water mixtures.

TI Tunica repair with acellular bladder matrix maintains corporal tissue
   function
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPOTENCE RESEARCH
AB Penile conditions, such as Peyronie's disease or tumor resection may require surgical reconstruction of the tunica albuginea. Various materials have been proposed, as a biomaterial for tunica albuginea repair, however, little functional data are available. We examined the applicability and functional outcome of a collagen-based matrix derived from the bladder ( acellular bladder matrix ( ABM)), as a biomaterial for tunica repair. Biocompatibility testing was performed on the matrix, which included mitochondrial metabolic activity, cell viability and apoptosis. Approximately 50% of the dorsal penile tunica albuginea was replaced with the collagen-based matrix patch after surgical removal in 24 New Zealand White rabbits. Cavernosometry and cavernosography were performed. The animals were killed 1, 2 and 3 months after surgery for analyses. The matrix showed excellent biocompatibility. All animals implanted with the matrix survived without any noticeable untoward effects. There was no evidence of inflammation or infection at the time of retrieval. Cavernosometry of the implanted animals demonstrated normal intracavernosal pressures with visual erections. Cavernosography of the repaired corpora showed a normal anatomical configuration. Biomechanical analysis of the retrieved matrices demonstrated similar tensile strengths as native tunica. Histologically, there was only a minimal inflammatory response, which gradually decreased over time. These results show that ABM is biocompatible, durable and effective when used as a tunica substitute. The matrix may be useful as an off-the-shelf biomaterial for patients requiring tunica albuginea repair.

TI A semi-empirical computational model for the inhibition of porcine
   cholesterol esterase
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB Cholesterol esterase significantly contributes to cell membrane structure. It also facilitates transfer of cholesterol and phospholipids across membranes. Inhibition of this enzyme by a number of xenobiotics has been reported. This research sought to confirm if a widely used methacrylate monomer, bisphenol A dimethacrylate, inhibits porcine cholesterol esterase since this and other methacrylates are known to leach from various biomaterial preparations. A quantum mechanically developed computational chemistry model is presented. Specific chemical information linking potential mechanisms of cholesterol esterase inhibition to chemical structure is shown. Model chemical descriptors identified the importance of maximum oxygen valency and molecular shape/size to cholesterol esterase inhibition. A porcine cholesterol esterase inhibition mechanism is inherent in bisphenol A dimethacrylate which mimics chemical properties of reported cholesterol esterase inhibitors. This predictive semiempirical quantum mechanical model can be used to design new cholesterol esterase non-inhibitors for biocompatible biomaterials used in an aqueous environment.

TI Structural and mechanical evaluations of a topology optimized titanium
   interbody fusion cage fabricated by selective laser melting process
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB A topology optimized lumbar interbody fusion cage was made of Ti-A16-V4 alloy by the rapid prototyping process of selective laser melting (SLM) to reproduce designed microstructure features. Radiographic characterizations and the mechanical properties were investigated to determine how the structural characteristics of the fabricated cage were reproduced from design characteristics using micro-computed tomography scanning. The mechanical modulus of the designed cage was also measured to compare with tantalum, a widely used porous metal. The designed microstructures can be clearly seen in the micrographs of the micro-CT and scanning electron microscopy examinations, showing the SLM process can reproduce intricate microscopic features from the original designs. No imaging artifacts from micro-CT were found. The average compressive modulus of the tested caged was 2.97 +/- 0.90 GPa, which is comparable with the reported porous tantalum modulus of 3 GPa and falls between that of cortical bone (15 GPa) and trabecular bone (0.1-0.5 GPa). The new porous Ti-6A14V optimal-structure cage fabricated by SLM process gave consistent mechanical properties without artifactual distortion in the imaging modalities and thus it can be a promising alternative as a porous implant for spine fusion.

TI Influence of the surface structure of a multiblock copolymer on the
   cellular behavior of primary cell cultures of the upper aerodigestive
   tract in vitro
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB The influence of the surface topography of a biodegradable copolymer on adhesion, proliferation, and cellular activity of primary cell cultures of the upper aerodigestive tract (ADT) was investigated. On the basis of the important functions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors, tissue inhibitor of MMPs (TIMPs) in regulating extracellular matrix remodeling, cellular adhesion and growth, the appearance and kinetics of these enzymes were investigated in primary cells of the upper ADT seeded on different surfaces of a polymeric biomaterial. Primary cell cultures of the upper ADT of Sprague-Dawley rats were seeded on different surfaces (smooth versus rough surface) of a biodegradable multiblock copolymer and on polystyrene surface as control. Conditioned media of the primary cells were analyzed for MMPs; and TIMPs by both zymography and radiometric enzyme assay. Cell adhesion and proliferation as well as the kinetics of appearance and activity level of MMP-1, MMP-2, and TIMPs were significantly different depending on the cell type and the surface structure of the multiblock copolymer. In this study, the data obtained indicated that surface topography governed the biological response to biomaterials. Knowledge as to how cells interact with the interface of biomaterials will be necessary in order to eventually design the "ideal" surface of biomaterials, which will be both tissue and organ-optimized in order to best provide clinicians with specific and viable novel therapeutical options in medicine.

TI Development of an engineering autologous palatal mucosa-like tissue for
   potential clinical applications
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS
AB The goal of this study was to optimize key processes in recreating functional and viable palatal mucosa-like tissue that would be easy to handle and would promote wound healing. Normal human gingival fibroblasts and epithelial cells and a clinically useful biomaterial, CollaTape (R), were used. Structural and ultrastructural analyses showed that the gingival fibroblasts and epithelial cells adhered to the biomaterial and proliferated. Following a 6-day culture, Using 105 fibroblasts and 106 epithelial cells, a well-organized palatal mucosa-like tissue was engineered. The engineered epithelium displayed various layers, including a stratum corneum, and contained cytokeratin 16-positive cells located in the supra-basal layer. This palatal mucosa-like engineered tissue was designed to meet a variety of surgical needs. The biodegradable collagen membrane (CollaTape) contributed to the flexibility of the engineered tissue. This engineered innovative tissue may contribute to the reconstruction of oral soft-tissue defects secondary to trauma, congenital defects, and acquired diseases. (C) 2007 Wilev Periodicals, Inc.

TI Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations of As(III) complexation with a
   cysteine-rich biomaterial
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Arsenite adsorption onto a protein-rich biomass and, more specifically, the chemical groups involved in the uptake were investigated using Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The study was based on spectroscopic analyses of raw and arsenic-loaded biomass as well as standard samples of amino acids and arsenic salts. The predominant secondary structure of the protein was identified as the beta-sheet type, with some contribution from alpha-helix structures. The participation of sulphydryl groups from cystine/cysteine molecules during the adsorption of arsenite was demonstrated. Only the gauche-gauche-gauche (g-g-g) conformation type of the disulfide bonds was involved in arsenic complexation. The formation of a pyramidal trigonal As(HCys)(3) complex was modeled according to the density functional theory (DFT). The agreement of the DFT harmonic frequencies with the RAMAN spectra of the As(HCys)(3) complex demonstrated the relevant features of the cysteine-rich biomaterial regarding arsenic uptake as well as of the mechanism involved in the As(III)/biomass interaction at a molecular level. The results also illustrate that Raman spectroscopy can be successfully applied to investigate the mechanism of metal adsorption onto amorphous biomaterials. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

TI Different effects of PLGA and chitosan scaffolds on human cartilage
   tissue engineering
SO JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY
AB Clinical application of the cartilage formed by tissue engineering is not practical due to the failure to maintain long-term tissue structural integrity. One of the important factors for maintaining integrity is the biomaterial for a scaffold. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the difference between poly-lactic glycolic acid (PLGA) and chitosan as scaffolds. Human auricular chondrocytes were used. Chondrocyte-scaffold complexes were implanted in nude mice and analyzed at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks after implantation. The volume of chondrocyte-PLGA complexes decreased rapidly. The volume of chondrocyte-chitosan complexes was well maintained with a slow decrease rate. In histological findings, mature cartilage was formed by 4 weeks in the PLGA group. However, cartilage structure was hardly found after 16 weeks. In the chitosan group, mature cartilage was detected at 8 weeks and cartilage formation became more marked with time. The expression of type 11 collagen protein and mRNA became weaker with time in the PLGA group. However, the expression in the chitosan group was strong for the whole period. These results suggest that chitosan is a superior scaffold for cartilage tissue engineering in terms of the maintenance of structural integrity. It is expected that after some modification for more rapid chondrogenesis, chitosan scaffolds may become one of the most useful scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering.

TI Synergistic action of protease-modulating matrix and autologous growth
   factors in healing of diabetic foot ulcers. A prospective randomized
   trial
SO JOURNAL OF DIABETES AND ITS COMPLICATIONS
AB This study tests the hypothesis that addition of a protease-modulating matrix enhances the efficacy of autologous growth factors in diabetic ulcers. Fifty-one patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcers were managed as outpatients at the Democritus University Hospital of Alexandroupolis and followed up for 8 weeks. All target ulcers were >= 2.5 cm in any one dimension and had been previously treated only with moist gauze. Patients were randomly allocated in three groups of 17 patients each: Group A was treated only with the oxidized regenerated cellulose/collagen biomaterial (Promogran, Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ), Group B was treated only with autologous growth factors delivered by Gravitational Platelet Separation System (GPS (TM), Biomet), and Group C was managed by a combination of both. All ulcers were digitally photographed at initiation of the study and then at change of dressings once weekly. Computerized planimetry (Texas Health Science Center ImageTool, Version 3.0) was used to assess ulcer dimensions that were analyzed for homogeneity and significance using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Version 13.0. Post hoc analysis revealed that there was significantly greater reduction of all three dimensions of the ulcers in Group C compared to Groups A and B (all P <.001). Although reduction of ulcer dimensions was greater in Group A than in Group B, these differences did not reach statistical significance. It is concluded that protease-modulating dressings act synergistically with autologous growth factors and enhance their efficacy in diabetic foot ulcers. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Spider capture silk: Performance implications of variation in an
   exceptional biomaterial
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-ECOLOGICAL GENETICS AND
   PHYSIOLOGY
AB Spiders and their silk are an excellent system for connecting the properties of biological materials to organismal ecology. Orb-weaving spiders spin sticky capture threads that are moderately strong but exceptionally extensible, resulting in fibers that can absorb remarkable amounts of energy. These tough fibers are thought to be adapted for arresting flying insects. Using tensile testing, we ask whether patterns can be discerned in the evolution of silk material properties and the ecological uses of spider capture fibers. Here, we present a large comparative data set that allows examination of capture silk properties across orb-weaving spider species. We find that material properties vary greatly across species. Notably, extensibility, strength, and toughness all vary approximately sixfold across species. These material differences, along with variation in fiber size, dictate that the mechanical performance of capture threads, the energy and force required to break fibers, varies by more than an order of magnitude across species. Furthermore, some material and mechanical properties are evolutionarily correlated. For example, species that spin small diameter fibers tend to have tougher silk, suggesting compensation to maintain breaking energy. There is also a negative correlation between strength and extensibility across species, indicating a potential evolutionary trade-off. The different properties of these capture silks should lead to differences in the performance of orb webs during prey capture and help to define feeding niches in spiders.

AB Percutaneous devices are extensively used in modern medicine therapies, even in long term applications. Complications from their use, related to bacterial colonization and/or to materials thrombogenicity, may result in a significant morbidity and mortality incidence. In this study, a novel polycarbonate-urethane (PCU), incorporating a tailor-made diamino-diamide-diol ( PIME) showing the ability to bind heparin at physiological pH, was compared to commercial medical-grade PCUs (Carbothane (R) and Bionate (R)). Mechanical and thermal properties were evaluated by tensile tests, dynamic mechanical analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The presence of a low amount of PIME chain extender in Bionate (R) polyurethanes (Bionate-PIME) slightly affects the mechanical properties, remaining however comparable with the medical grade PCUs used for the fabrication of cardiovascular devices. To verify thereof heparin surface adsorbed in disfavouring bacterial colonization, heparinized Bionate-PIME was tested for bacterial adhesion, using Bionate (R) and Carbothane (R) as reference. In vitro bacterial interaction tests were performed with the strains mainly involved in the pathogenesis of device-related infections (S. epidermidis and S. aureus). MTT tests and SEM observations showed a decrease in colonization of the different strains on the heparinized Bionate-PIME surfaces, confirming that preadsorbed heparin plays a role in mediating the biomaterial surface/bacterial cells interactions.

AB Porous hydroxyapatite/collagen (HAp/Col) composite is a promising biomaterial and a scaffold for bone tissue engineering. The effect of fibril formation of Col in the porous composite on bioresorbability and mechanical strength was investigated. The fibril formation, in mixing a self-organized HAp/Col nanocomposite and sodium phosphate buffer at a neutral condition, occurred during incubation at 37 degrees C, resulting in gelation of the mixture. The porous composites with and without the incubation were obtained by freeze-drying technique, in which macroscopic open pores were formed. The compressive strength of the porous composite with the incubation (34.1 +/- 1.6 kPa) was significantly higher than that without the incubation (28.0 +/- 3.3 kPa) due to the fibril formation of Col. The implantations of the porous composites treated with a dehydrothermal treatment in bone holes revealed that bioresorption was clearly depended on the fibril formation. The bioresorbability in vivo was almost matched to the in vitro test using enzymatic reaction of collagenase.

AB Objective To examine biomaterial biocompatibility and improve current methods of immunological evaluation TNF-alpha and IL1-beta were used as indicators at mRNA levels.
   Methods Rat peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with different biomaterials and expression of TNF-alpha and IL1-beta was measured by RT-PCR and compared within different groups.
   Results Macrophages that were stimulated with PTFE produced significantly more TNF-a and IL1-b than unstimulated macrophages (p < 0.001). The PLGA, NPG, beta-TCP, and CPC groups also induced moderate TNF-alpha and IL1-b expression (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions TNF-alpha and IL1-beta are sensitive indicators of immune stimulation that can help to monitor the levels of cellular activation induced by different biomaterials. Our findings showed that beta-TCP and CPC had a good biocompability, and CPC was the most biocompatible of all the biomaterials tested. While PTFE and NPG still had side effect because of producing pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro once implanted.

AB Hydrogels composed of collagen and hyaluronic acid are types of crosslinked water-swellable polymers and possess vast potential for applications in the medical industry. Collagen (Co) is the major structural protein of connective tissues such as skin, tendon and cartilage. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a non-immunogenic, non-adhesive glycosaminoglycan that has a high water absorption property and plays significant roles in several cellular processes. The purpose of this study is to prepare a collagen (Co)-modified hyaluronic acid (MHA) hydrogel and investigate its potential utility for biomedical products such as wound dressing materials. Collagen (Co, type 1) was obtained from pig skin and mucopolysaccharide-HA was modified by a poly (ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE) crosslinker. Thermal stability, swelling behavior, and mechanical strength of Co-MHA hydrogel according to different mass ratios of Co and MHA in hydrogel networks were investigated. The physical properties of the hydrogel were measured by SEM, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermal Gravity Analysis (TGA), and a Universal Testing Machine (UTM). The cell viability of Co-MHA hydrogel was also evaluated using an in vitro MTT assay.

AB This paperwork deals with the obtaining of a new radio-opaque biomaterial that can be used in the manufacture of bone or dental cements. We have obtained some radio-opaque copolymers based on methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 2-iodothiophene (ITf). The copolymers were characterised by Gel Permeation Chromatography and their molecular weights were obtained. Next, they were subjected to viscosity analysis to evaluate the K and a constants from Kuhn-Mark-Houwink-Sakurada equation. The values for the two constants showed an increase of the rigidity of the macromolecular chains, approaching as shape the model of the rigid rod. The biocompatibility of the copolymers was tested in vitro on an L929 cell line of murine fibroblasts and these materials revealed no cytotoxic effect upon the cells. These results combined with the excellent radio-opacity of the materials lead to the suggestion that this type of polymers could be used as dental or bone cements for the replacement of barium or zirconium particles usually added to provide X-ray opacity.

AB Over the last three decades the bioactive ceramics including bioglasses, glass-ceramics, sintered hydroxyapatite, become one of the major fields in biomaterials., due to their intimate bond with living bone through the formation of a biologically active carbonate apatite interface layer. The purpose of the work was to examine the structure of a calcium silicate bioactive glass prepared by the sol-gel method. The samples were characterized by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). No traces of organic matter or nitrates in the stabilized material were found according to FTIR and TG/DTA measurements. The materials produced are amorphous even after stabilization at 700 degrees C up to about 850 degrees C. However, the materials sinterized at 1000 degrees C for 1 hour reveal crystalline phase and indeed that of CaSiO3 (wollastonite). Thus, the materials prepared by the sol-gel method are homogeneous with high purity and after their stabilization below their crystallization temperature, they are amorphous. These characteristics allow their application in the area of orthopedic and dental implants as a bone substitute biomaterial.

The simulated artificial saliva are Afnor and Tani-Zucchi solutions and implant materials are Ti and TiAI-V. Infrared (IR) and Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) methods were performed in order to identify the structure and composition of the film reformed after immersion in saliva and corrosion process. Despite of good corrosion resistance of Ti and Ti-Al-V alloy which was put in evidence using electrochemical methods [1-3], Ti and Ti-Al-V immersed in simulated medium of Afnor and Tani-Zucchi for longer time noticed small effects of a local corrosion as an intercrystalline type.

AB The accuracy and precision of spectrochemical analysis of metallic biocompatible grades, especially AISI 316 grades, should be superior to the routine ones because they must fulfill rigorous chemical composition specified by ISO 5832-1 standard. As it is known, the atomic emission spectrometry (AES) is the most used technique in instrumental elemental analysis of metallic materials due to its high ratio efficiency-cost. But, exactneess of AES spectrochemical analysis of 316L grades depend on some critical factors as: sample microstructure; nature, size and distribution of inclusions; inter elements interferences, sample preparation etc[1,2]. This is way the ISO 5832-1 doesn't recommend AES for complete elemental analysis of 316L D and E alloy types.

AB Bony grafts are used as a filling biomaterial for defective bone. The introduction of new range of synthetic materials offers to surgeons additional possibilities to avoid virus transmission risks by using natural grafts in bony surgery. In this work, two materials, synthetic calcium carbonate and composite aluminosilicate/calcium phosphate were synthesized by an original method and experimented "in vivo" as biomaterials for bony filling. Extracted biopsies were studied by several physico chemical and biological methods. The aim was to evaluate the kinetic resorption and bioconsolidation of these materials. We focused on the bioconsolidation between implant and bone by realising cartographies from the implant to the bone and on the calcification mechanism by determination of the origin of Ca and Sr responsible of the neo-formed bone. Neutron activation analysis (NAA), radiotracers Ca-45* and Sr-85* and proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) were used. Concerning the synthetic calcium carbonate, results show that twelve months after implantation, the mineral composition of implant becomes similar to that of the mature bone. The neoformed bone is composed with Ca and Sr coming from the organism when the Ca and Sr of the implant were progressively eliminated. Concerning the composite geopolymer/calcium phosphate, PIXE and histological studies reveal the intimate links between the bone and the implant starting with the first month after implantation.

TI Effect of milling treatment on texture development of hydroxyapatite
   ceramics by slip casting in high magnetic field
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB Hydroxyapatite (HAP, Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2)) is a main component of bones and teeth, and a specific crystal orientation is required for biomaterial application. In this study, the effects of the processing parameters on the orientation, such as de-agglomeration by milling procedure, applied magnetic field and sintering temperatures, were examined. Using the de-agglomerated particle by a milling procedure, it is possible to control the particle orientation, but when using heavily agglomerated particles, it was impossible to control the particle orientation by applying a high magnetic field. Highly-textured HAP can be fabricated by slip casting using a well-dispersed suspension in a high magnetic field (above 4 T) followed by sintering above 1373 K.

SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB Superelasticity of beta Ti-16 at%Nb-4.8 at%Sn alloy consisting of non- (or minimal-) cytotoxic elements was investigated for biomedical applications as functions of,deformation temperature and aging heat treatment after quenching. As-quenched Ti-16Nb-4.8Sn having A(f) (the reverse martensitic transformation finish temperature) of 266K exhibits superelasticity at human body temperature (310K) with an elastic recovery strain of 3.2%. Af decreases with increasing aging temperature in the range of 353 to 423 K or with increasing aging time at 423 K. It is confirmed from TEM observation and Young's modulus measurements that omega) transformation occurs on aging at 423 K for 500 h. Stress for inducing martensitic transformation, am, increases with aging. Stress-strain curves showing superelasticity are quite similar to each other when as-quenched or aged samples are deformed at such temperatures that they have the same sigma M. It is concluded that maximum superelastic recovery strain can be obtained at intended temperature, e.g. human body temperature, in beta Ti-Nb-Sn alloys by aging at relatively low temperatures.

TI Manipulating biopolymer dynamics by anisotropic nanoconfinement
SO NANO LETTERS
AB How the geometry of nanosized confinement affects dynamics of biomaterials is interesting yet poorly understood. An elucidation of structural details upon nanosized confinement may benefit manufacturing pharmaceuticals in biomaterial sciences and medicine. The behavior of biopolymers in nanosized confinement is investigated using coarse-grained models and molecular simulations. Particularly, we address the effects of shapes of a confinement on protein-folding dynamics by measuring folding rates and dissecting structural properties of the transition states in nanosized spheres and ellipsoids. We find that when the form of a confinement resembles the geometrical properties of the transition states, the rates of folding kinetics are most enhanced. This knowledge of shape selectivity in identifying optimal conditions for reactions will have a broad impact in nanotechnology and, pharmaceutical sciences.

TI Microfluidic scaffolds for tissue engineering
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB Most methods to culture cells in three dimensions depend on a cell-seedable biomaterial to define the global structure of the culture and the microenvironment of the cells. Efforts to tailor these scaffolds have focused on the chemical and mechanical properties of the biomaterial itself. Here, we present a strategy to control the distributions of soluble chemicals within the scaffold with convective mass transfer via microfluidic networks embedded directly within the cell-seeded biomaterial. Our presentation of this strategy includes: a lithographic technique to build functional microfluidic structures within a calcium alginate hydrogel seeded with cells; characterization of this process with respect to microstructural fidelity and cell viability; characterization of convective and diffusive mass transfer of small and large solutes within this microfluidic scaffold; and demonstration of temporal and spatial control of the distribution of non-reactive solutes and reactive solutes (that is, metabolites) within the bulk of the scaffold. This approach to control the chemical environment on a micrometre scale within a macroscopic scaffold could aid in engineering complex tissues.

TI Histological and ultrastructural evaluation of bone around Bio-Oss((R))
   particles in sinus augmentation
SO ORAL DISEASES
AB Aim The aim of the present study was to evaluate histological and ultrastructural features of bone surrounding Bio-Oss((R)) particles retrieved, in the same patient, 20 months and 7 years after sinus augmentation.
   Materials and Methods A 54-year patient who needed sinus elevation before implant rehabilitation participated in this study. Two bone cores at two different times were harvested from a Bio-Oss((R)) regenerated sinus and processed for examination under light and transmission electron microscopy.
   Conclusions Under light microscopy, in the 20-month specimen, most of the particles were surrounded by a thin layer of newly formed bone; in the 7-year specimen there was mainly compact bone in direct contact with the particles. Under transmission electron microscopy, it was possible to characterize the bone-biomaterial interface; in the 20-month specimen an electron-dense layer was seen, whereas, almost no electron-dense lines were seen at the interface in the 7-year specimen.
   Bio-Oss((R)) particles did not interfere with bone-healing processes after sinus augmentation procedures and promoted new bone formation. This study can help clinicians to understand better the morphological characteristics of bone regeneration processes using Bio-Oss((R)) after 20 months and, most importantly, after a longer time of interaction with surrounding tissues.

TI Oxidative and enzymatic degradations of L-tyrosine based polyurethanes
SO POLYMER DEGRADATION AND STABILITY
AB Oxidative and enzymatic degradations Of L-tyrosine based polyurethanes were studied for biomaterial applications. Oxidative degradation was performed with 0.1 M cobalt chloride (CoCl2) in hydrogen peroxide solutions at 37 degrees C and the degradation was assessed by ATR-FTIR. Results indicate that polyurethane with polyethylene glycol (PEG) shows soft segment degradation while polyurethane based on polycaprolactone (PCL) shows hard segment degradation. Enzymatic degradation of the polyurethanes was studied using proteolytic enzyme a-chymotrypsin in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C. The enhanced degradability Of L-tyrosine based polyurethanes is due to both the presence of amino acid based chain extender and the action of enzyme. The changes in the morphology of polyurethanes were analyzed by SEM. The results of the degradation study were correlated to the structure of the polyurethanes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Chitosan-hyaluronic acid hybrid film as a novel wound dressing: in vitro
   and in vivo studies
SO POLYMERS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES
AB Wound dressing with high quality is a kind of highly demanded wound-repairing products. In this article, chitosan (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were used to fabricate a novel wound dressing. CS/HA composite films with high transparency could be fabricated on glass or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrates, but not on poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) plate. Along with the increase of HA amount, the resulting films became rougher as detected by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Increased also are water contact angle and water-uptake ratio. By contrast, increase of the HA amount weakened the water vapor permeability (WVP), bovine albumin adsorption, and fibroblast adhesion, which are desirable characteristics for wound dressing. In vivo animal test revealed that compared with the vaseline gauge the CS/HA film could more effectively accelerate the wound healing, and reduce the occurrence of re-injury when peeling off the dressing again. These results demonstrate that the CS mixed with a little amount of HA may produce inexpensive wound dressing with good properties for practical applications.

TI Dopant control over the crystal morphology of ceramic materials
SO SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Doping is a common way to activate the behavior of ceramics. Its effect is not limited to the bulk: segregation of dopants to the surfaces also yields a way to modify, and ultimately control the crystal morphology. We propose a model that allows us to calculate the surface energy beyond the Langmuir isotherm for doped and defective surfaces from atomic-level simulations. The model also allows us to account for different compositions between the bulk and surface. Computational materials design can thus be applied to optimize simultaneously the crystal behavior at the atomic (surface structure and composition) and mesoscopic (crystal size and shape) length scales. We exemplify the model with orthorhombic CaTiO3 perovskite doped with Mg2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Sr2+, Ba2+ and Cd2+ ions, by predicting the effect that different dopants and dopant concentrations have on the crystal morphology. We find that a higher proportion of reactive {021} and {111} surfaces are exposed with the presence of divalent Mg2+, Fe2+ and Ni2+ ions than in the undoped material and in perovskite doped with Ba2+ and Sr2+center dot Cd2+ has only minor effects on crystal morphologies. These findings have important implications for predicting the reactivity of crystals doped with different ions and we show how this can be related to a simple parameter such as the ionic radius. We have tested our newly derived model by comparison with laboratory flux grown single crystals of CaTiO3, (Ni,Ca)TiO3 and (Ba,Ca)TiO3 and find excellent agreement between theory and experiment.

TI Development of novel scaffolds for tissue engineering by flock
   technology
SO TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB Flock technology is a method well known in the textile industry. Short fibers are applied almost vertically on a substrate, coated with a flocking adhesive. Until now, this technology has not been used in the field of biomaterials. Our aim was to use electrostatic flocking for fabricating a novel type of scaffolds for tissue engineering. This method offers the possibility to create matrices with anisotropic properties that have a high compressive strength despite high porosity. First, experiments were performed using a membrane made of mineralized collagen as substrate, gelatine as adhesive and polyamide flock fibers. Different kinds of cells were cultured in the scaffolds for up to six weeks. Using microscopic methods and biochemical analyses, we could demonstrate that cells adhered and proliferated well in this new type of scaffold. Therefore, we can summarize that flocking is a technology suitable for fabrication of scaffolds for cell cultivation and tissue engineering.

AB Potentiodynamic electrochemical technique was utilized to study the corrosion behavior of magnesium alloys in simulated body fluids (SBFs). The influence of materials, solutions and their temperature on corrosion rate was mainly discussed. The results demonstrate that the free corrosion potential (E-corr) of AZ31 and AZ91 alloys rises rapidly at initial stage, and then stabilizes at some value. E-corr of WE43 alloy increases continuously. While E-corr of AZ91 alloy with macro-arc oxidation (MAO) coating decreases drastically in 3 min, and then fluctuates between -1 607 mV and -1 503 mV. The WE43 alloy has better corrosion resistance in Hank's solution, compared with AZ31 and AZ91 alloys. Corrosion rates of the alloys are sensitive to the chemical composition and temperature of SBFs. A thin MgF2 film slightly improves corrosion resistance. An MAO coating on AZ91 alloy significantly reduces corrosion rate and enhances EO,. Pitting corrosion occurs on both AZ31 and WE43 alloys in Hank's solution.

TI Nanostructured biodegradable polymer composites generated using
   lyotropic liquid crystalline media
SO MACROMOLECULES
AB In tissue engineering applications the physical properties and degradation behavior of the designed synthetic scaffold are crucial for successful growth and function of desired tissue. Combining two or more biodegradable polymers into a single biomaterial composite may provide a pathway toward achieving new and highly tailorable biomaterial properties by taking advantage of the distinct properties from each blend component. In this work, a nanostructured lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) was used to induce miscibility between blends of two immiscible biodegradable polymer systems, leading to the formation of a compatible composite with advanced properties. The physical properties and degradative behavior of biomaterials made from formulations of PLA-b-PEG-b-PLA dimethacrylate, caprolactone dimethacrylate, and ethyloxy succinate dimethacrylate were directly controlled using the composition of each material, demonstrating that a high degree of compatibility can be attained from immiscible biopolymer systems using the LLC polymerization template. Specifically, by initially confining the immiscible monomers into the nanometer scale domains of the liquid crystal, composite materials were formed upon cross-linking that demonstrated IPN-type behavior with linear or additive contributions from each biopolymer constituent. The use of a nanostructured LLC to compatibilize, immiscible biodegradable monomers represents a significant advancement in the formation of cross-linked biocomposites with highly tailorable properties for tissue engineering applications.

TI Development and characterization of photopolymerizable biodegradable
   materials from PEG-PLA-PEG block macromonomers
SO POLYMER
AB As tissue engineering and drug delivery applications increase in both number and complexity, the demand for new synthetic biocompatible polymers with precisely tailored properties grows accordingly. Block copolymers are a particularly promising biomaterial as the physical and physiological properties of these polymers can be closely controlled through manipulation of the type and organization of the blocks in the polymer's backbone. In this work, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) were incorporated into PEG-PLA-PEG block macromonomers with (meth)acrylate functionality to form photopolymerizable, highly cross-linked polymers for potential use in a variety of biomedical applications. Simply by directing the PLA:PEG ratio in these macromonomers, the hydrophobicity, physical behavior, degradation, and biocompatibility of the resulting polymer were controlled. Specifically, it was found that by increasing the PLA:PEG ratio, the degree of water uptake and the mechanical strength of the material is significantly decreased, while the glass transition temperature and degradation of the PEG-PLA polymers are delayed. Additionally, the biocompatibility of the PEG-PLA polymers is significantly influenced by the chemical composition of the material as increased PLA generally yields greater cell compatibility. By demonstrating the versatility of the photopolymerizable PEG-PLA polymers, the results of this study indicate that these materials have the potential to serve as a synthetic biomaterial platform, in which the properties of the polymer can be tailored to a variety of tissue engineering or drug delivery applications.

The P-O bonds to bridging and non-bridging oxygens are less well resolved in the neutron data from the samples containing CaO, suggesting a change in the nature of the bonding as the field strength of the cation increases Na+ -> Ca2(+). In the (CaO)(0.5)(P2O5)(0.5) glass most of the Ca2+ ions are present in isolated CaOx polyhedra whereas in the (Na2O)(0.5) (P2O5)(0.5) glass the NaOx polyhedra share edges leading to a Na-Na correlation. The results of the structural study are related to the properties of the (CaO)(0.4) (Na2O)(0.1) (P2O5)(0.5) biomaterial.

TI Degradation of Poly(L-Lactide) films under ultravioletInduced
   photografting and sterilization conditions
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB The degradation of polymers under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation has been a great concern for biomaterial and agricultural applications. The major objective of this research was to study the effect of UV irradiation on the representative bulk and surface properties of poly (L-lactide) (PLA) films. Two UV sources with different spectral outputs and intensities were chosen so that one of them could be used for surface modification and the other could be used for UV sterilization of the PLA films. The results established that the molecular weight of PLA decreased significantly during irradiation from the photografting lamp under atmospheric conditions. Irradiation through a Pyrex container was shown to minimize polymer degradation during UV exposure from the photografting lamp. The PLA films UV-irradiated under the sterilization lamp for 12 h revealed a similar reduction in the molecular weight and no change in the surface hydrophilicity. However, significantly less photo-degradation was observed under the sterilization lamp when the samples were held in a Pyrex container. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-Poly(ethylene glycol))-acrylate
   simultaneously physically and chemically gelling polymer systems
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB In an effort to create an in situ physically and chemically cross-linked hydrogel for in vivo applications, N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) was copolymerized with poly(ethylene glycol)-monoacrylate (PEG-monoacrylate) and then the hydroxyl terminus of the PEG was further modified with acryloyl chloride to form poly(NI-PAAm-co-PEG) with acrylate terminated pendant groups. In addition to physically gelling with temperature changes, when mixed with a multi-thiol compound such as pentaerythritol tetrakis 3-mercaptopropionate (QT) in phosphate buffer saline solution of pH 7.4, this polymer formed a chemical gel via a Michael-type addition reaction. The chemical gelation time of the polymer was affected by mixing time; swelling of the copolymer solutions was temperature dependant. Because of its unique gelation properties, this material may be better suited for long-term functional replacement applications than other thermo-sensitive physical gels. Also, the PEG content of this material may render it more biocompatible than similar HEMA-based precursors in previous simultaneous chemically and physically gelling materials. With its improved mechanical strength and biocompatibility, this material could potentially be applied as a thermally gelling injectable biomaterial for aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (AVM) occlusion.

TI Structure and properties of collagen-konjac glucomannan-sodium alginate
   blend films
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB A new kind of blend film was made by mixing the solutions of Collagen, konjac glucommnnan (KGM), and sodium alginate. The structure of the blend film was characterized by FTIR, XRD, atomic absorption spectrophotometer, and SEM, respectively. The effects of weight ratio between the polymers on light transmittance, tensile strength, elongation at break, water permeability, and water absorption of the film were studied. The results showed that there were strong interactions and good compatibility between collagen, KGM, and sodium alginate in the film. The film possesses good mechanical properties. Therefore, it can be applied in biomedicine as a new type of biomaterial. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Application of the avidin-biotin interaction to immobilize DNA in the
   development of electrochemical impedance genosensors
SO ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Impedance spectroscopy is a rapidly developing technique for the transduction of biosensing events at the surface of an electrode. The immobilization of biomaterial as DNA strands on the electrode surface alters the capacitance and the interfacial electron transfer resistance of the conductive electrodes. The impedimetric technique is an effective method of probing modifications to these interfacial properties, thus allowing the differentiation of hybridization events. In this work, an avidin bulk-modified graphite-epoxy biocomposite (Av-GEB) was employed to immobilize biotinylated oligonucleotides as well as double-stranded DNA onto the electrode surface. Impedance spectra were recorded to detect the change in the interfacial electron transfer resistance (R (et)) of the redox marker ferrocyanide/ferricyanide at a polarization potential of +0.17 V. The sensitivity of the technique and the good reproducibility of the results obtained with it confirm the validity of this method based on a universal affinity biocomposite platform coupled with the impedimetric technique.

SO ANNALS OF OTOLOGY RHINOLOGY AND LARYNGOLOGY
AB Objectives: Plastipore prostheses are still used by many surgeons, although the functional results are controversial. The aim of this study was the morphological analysis of Plastipore material performance in the middle ear of rats, with special attention to extrusion.
   Methods: Twenty-four Wistar rats were given implants made of commercially available Plastipore and assigned to 3 groups: group A, with implantation in a healthy middle ear; group B, with implantation and cauterization of the nasopharyngeal orifice of the eustachian tube (hypoventilation); and group C, with implantation, cauterization of the eustachian tube, and bacterial inoculation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
   Results: The pathological study showed in nearly all cases the disintegration of the biomaterial. Adhesion between the biomaterial and bone could be seen in 1 rat from group C (hypoventilation and infection). In group C, the Plastipore was in contact with the tympanic membrane in 1 case and was extruding in 2 animals. Different phases of extrusion were defined. No extrusion was observed in the other groups.
   Conclusions: The sequential stages of Plastipore extrusion are demonstrated. Infection seems to be the most important factor in Plastipore extrusion in our model.

SO ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY
AB Purpose: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the structural properties of matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation with multiple fixation techniques implanted in fresh porcine knees after they had undergone load to failure.
   Methods: We evaluated the ultimate failure load, yield load, and stiffness of 3 different techniques for the fixation of a 2-mm thick polymer fleece: (1) fixation with biodegradable polylevolactide pins, (2) a transosseous anchoring technique, and (3) conventional suture fixation. Techniques I (pin) and 2 (transosseous anchoring) can be used arthroscopically.
   Results: Maximum load and yield load were significantly higher in the group I (pin fixation) and group 2 (transosseous anchoring) compared to group 3 (conventional suture). Stiffness was significantly higher in group I than in groups 2 or 3.
   Conclusions: Our biomechanical data show that two fixation techniques (pin fixation and transosseous anchoring) have a higher ultimate load, yield load, and stiffness than the conventional suture technique at time point zero. However, these data can be interpreted only with the Bioceed-C matrix (BioTissue Technologies GmbH, Freiburg, Germany).
   Clinical Relevance: Our biomechanical data show outstanding fixation strength with arthroscopic techniques that use Bioceed-C matrix scaffolds during autologous chondrocyte transplantation. Thus, arthroscopic fixation done with this biomaterial should benefit patients, which, in turn, should lead to further research on these arthroscopic techniques and this biomaterial.

TI Tissue engineering for bone regeneration: stem cells and growth factors
   in biomaterial scaffolds
SO ASIAN BIOMEDICINE
AB Background. Bone tissue engineering requires a scaffold conducive to cell attachment and maintenance of cell function, together with a rich source of osteoprogenitor cells in combination with osteoinductive growth factors. Bone loss as a result of trauma or disease is an increasingly serious health problem. The requirement for new bone to replace or restore the function of injured, damaged, or lost bone is a major clinical and socioeconomic need. Bone defects still represent a major challenge for orthopaedic and reconstructive surgeons.
   Objective: This review aims at outlining the role of stem cells and growth factors in scaffolds, focusing on the use of mesenchymal stem cells and bone morphogenetic proteins as applied to the research and practice of bone tissue engineering.
   Results and conclusion: Bone tissue engineering has been emerging as a valid approach to the current therapies for bone regeneration. Therefore, tissue engineering offers a number of possible strategies to the generation of living prosthesis that could integrate with host tissue reducing the need for further surgery or possible implant failure.

TI Hemocompatibility of hydrophilic antimicrobial copolymers of alkylated
   4-vinylpyridine
SO BIOMACROMOLECULES
AB Quaternized poly(vinylpyridine) (PVP) is a polymer with inherent antimicrobial properties that is effective against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, viruses, and yeast cells. However, quaternized PVP has poor biocompatibility, which prevents its use in biomaterial applications. Copolymerization was examined as a method of modifying the structure to incorporate biocompatibility. Polyethyleneglycol methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) and hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) are polymers generally known to be biocompatible and thus were chosen as comonomers. Random copolymers of 4-vinylpyridine and PEGMA or HEMA were synthesized via free radical polymerization and quaternized with bromohexane. Copolymer biocompatibility was characterized by interaction with human red blood cells to analyze hemolysis. Hemolysis of human red blood cells was conducted on insoluble films and on water-soluble polymers in a serial dilution study. Hemolysis results demonstrated that blood compatibility does not depend on PEG chain length in PEGMA incorporated copolymers. Results indicate a critical weight ratio of PEGMA to VP in copolymers separating the no-hemolysis regime from 100% hemolysis.

TI Cell adhesion biomaterial based on mussel adhesive protein fused with
   RGD peptide
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Previously, we designed and constructed a hybrid of the mussel adhesive protein (MAP) fp-151, which is a fusion protein with six type 1 (fp-1) decapeptide repeats at each type 5 (fp-5) terminus. Through various cell-adhesion analyses, we previously demonstrated that fp-151 has the potential to be used as a cell or tissue bioadhesive. In the present study, to improve the cell-adhesion properties of fp-151, we designed a new cell-adhesive protein, fp-151-RGD, which is a fusion with the GRGDSP residues, a RGD peptide sequence that has previously been identified at the cell-attachment site of fibronectin, at the C-terminus of fp-151. Although recombinant fp-151-RGD maintained the advantages associated with fp-151, such as a high production yield in Escherichia coli and simple purification, it showed superior spreading ability, which is important for cell proliferation under serum-free conditions, as well as better cell-adhesion ability compared with other commercially produced cell-adhesion materials such as poly-L-lysine (PLL) and the naturally extracted MAP mixture Cell-Tak. The excellent adhesion and spreading abilities of fp-151-RGD might be due to the fact that it utilizes three types of cell-binding mechanisms: DOPA adhesion of Cell-Tak, cationic binding force of PLL, and RGD sequence-mediated adhesion of fibronectin. Therefore, the new recombinant fp-151-RGD is suitable for use as a cell-adhesion material in cell culture or tissue engineering, and in any other area where efficient cell adhesion is required.

TI The inhibition of the adhesion of clinically isolated bacterial strains

   coatings
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB This study examined bacterial adhesion to a new multi-component cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol)-based polymer coating that can be applied by spin-coating or spraying onto diverse biomaterials. Adhesion of five clinically isolated bacterial strains involved in biomaterial-centered infections were studied in a parallel-plate flow chamber at different shear rates and after exposure of the coating to different physiological fluids. The new chemistry inhibits non-specific biomolecular and cell binding interactions. Relative to glass, the coating reduced adhesion of all strains used in this study by more than 80%, with the exception of Escherichia coli O2K2. Reductions in adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis 3399 persisted beyond 168 h exposure of the coatings to phosphate buffered saline or urine, but not after exposure to protein-rich fluids as saliva and blood plasma, despite evidence from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that the coating integrity was not affected by exposure to these fluids. We conclude that this new coating chemistry provides beneficial properties to prevent or hinder bacterial adhesion and colonization in applications where low protein-conditions prevail.

TI In vitro biocompatibility of an ultrafine grained zirconium
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB We have investigated a novel ultrafine grained (UFG) Zr obtained by severe plastic deformation (SPD) which resulted in a refinement of the grain size by several orders of magnitude. Compared to conventional Zr, higher hardness values were measured on UFG Zr. Polished surfaces having similar topographical features from both materials were prepared, as assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Surface hydrophobicity of Zr, evaluated by measuring water contact angles, was unaffected by grain size reduction. In vitro biocompatibility was addressed on conventional and UFG Zr surfaces and, for comparative purposes, a polished Ti6Al4 V alloy was also investigated. Cell attachment and spreading, actin and beta-tubulin cytoskeleton reorganisation, fibronectin secretion and cellular distribution as well as cell viability were evaluated by culturing human osteoblastic Saos-2 cells on the surfaces. The osteoblastic response to conventional Zr was found to be essentially identical to Ti6Al4V and was not affected by grain size reduction. In order to evaluate the ability of the surfaces to promote osteogenic maturation and bone matrix mineralisation, human mesenchymal cells from bone marrow were switched to the osteoblastic phenotype by incubation in osteogenic induction media. Compared to undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, alkaline phosphatase activity and formation of mineralisation nodules were enhanced to the same extent on both Zr surfaces and Ti6Al4V alloy after induction of osteoblastic differentiation. In summary, improved mechanical properties together with excellent in vitro biocompatibility make UFG Zr a promising biomaterial for surgical implants. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Competitive-protein adsorption in contact activation of blood factor XII
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Contact activation of blood factor XII (FXII, Hageman factor) is moderated by the protein composition of the fluid phase in which FXII is dissolved. Solution yield of FXIIa arising from FXII contact with hydrophilic activating particles (fully water-wettable glass) suspended in a protein cocktail is shown to be significantly greater than that obtained under corresponding activation conditions in buffer solutions containing only FXII. By contrast, solution yield of FXIIa arising from FXII contact with hydrophobic particles (silanized glass) suspended in protein cocktail is sharply lower than that obtained in buffer. This confirms that contact activation is not specific to anionic hydrophilic surfaces as proposed by the accepted biochemistry of surface activation. Rather, contact activation in the presence of proteins unrelated to the plasma coagulation cascade leads to an apparent specificity for hydrophilic surfaces that is actually due to a relative diminution of activation at hydrophobic surfaces and an enhancement at hydrophilic surfaces. Furthermore, the rate of FXIIa accumulation in whole-plasma and buffer solution is found to decrease with time in the continuous presence of activating surfaces, leading to a steady-state FXIIa yield dependent on the initial FXII solution concentration for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic procoagulant particles suspended in either plasma, protein cocktail, or buffer. These results strongly suggest that activation competes with an autoinhibition reaction in which FXIIa itself inhibits FXII FXIIa. Experimental results are modeled using a reaction scheme invoking FXII activation and autoinhibition linked to protein adsorption to procoagulant surfaces, where FXII activation is presumed face FXIIa to proceed by either autoactivation (FXII (surface)-> FXIIa) and autohydrolysis (FXII (FXIIa)-> 2FXIIa) in buffer solution or autoactivation and reciprocal activation (kallikrein-mediated hydrolysis) in plasma. FXII adsorption competition with other proteins in the fluid phase is proposed to affect the balance of activation and autoinhibition, leading to the observed moderation of FXIIa yield.

TI Noninvasive nuclear factor-kappa B bioluminescence imaging for the
   assessment of host-biomaterial interaction in transgenic mice
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The inflammatory response is a key component in the biocompatibility of biomaterials. Among the factors that control the development of inflammation is a critical molecule nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of noninvasive whole-body real-time imaging for the evaluation of host-biomaterial interaction in the NF-kappa B transgenic mice. Transgenic mice, carrying the luciferase gene under the control of NF-kappa B, were constructed. In vivo bioluminescence imaging showed that the constitutive and induced NF-kappa B activities of transgenic mice were detected in most of the lymphoid tissues, demonstrating that NF-kappa B-driven luminescence reflected the inflammatory response in vivo. By the implantation of genipin-cross-linked gelatin conduit (GGC) and bacterial endotoxin-immersed GGC in the dorsal region, we detected a strong and specific luminescent signal from the tissue around the bacterial endotoxin-immersed GGC implant. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis also demonstrated that inflammation, characterized by the infiltration of immune cells, the accumulation of fluid, and the activation of NF-kappa B, was evoked around the same region. The correlation between the bioluminescence imaging and histological changes indicated that noninvasive imaging technique could be used to monitor the real-time inflammation in the implanted mice.

TI Elastin as a biomaterial for tissue engineering
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Biomaterials based upon elastin and elastin-derived molecules are increasingly investigated for their application in tissue engineering. This interest is fuelled by the remarkable properties of this structural protein, such as elasticity, self-assembly, long-term stability, and biological activity. Elastin can be applied in biomaterials in various forms, including insoluble elastin fibres, hydrolysed soluble elastin, recombinant tropoelastin (fragments), repeats of synthetic peptide sequences and as block copolymers of elastin, possibly in combination with other (bio)polymers. In this review, the properties of various elastin-based materials will be discussed, and their current and future applications evaluated. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Physical properties of alginate hydrogels and their effects on in vitro
   follicle development
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The mechanical properties and density of natural and synthetic extracellular matrices are known to affect cellular processes and regulate tissue formation. In this report, these factors were independently investigated for their role in ovarian follicle development. The matrix composition was controlled through decreasing the solids concentration or the molar mass of the encapsulating biomaterial, alginate. Decreasing matrix stiffness and solids concentration enhanced follicle growth and coordinated differentiation of the follicle cell types, as evidenced by antral cavity formation, theca cell differentiation, oocyte maturation, and relative hormone production levels. While a stiff environment favored high progesterone and androgen secretion, decreasing alginate stiffness resulted in estrogen production which exceeded progesterone and androgen accumulation. These studies reveal, for the first time, a direct link between the biomechanical environment and follicle function, and suggest a novel non-hormonal mechanism regulating follicle development.

TI Silk fibroin matrices for the controlled release of nerve growth factor
   (NGF)
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Nerve conduits (NC) for peripheral nerve repair should guide the sprouting axons and physically protect the axonal cone from any damage. The NC should also degrade after completion of its function to obviate the need of subsequent explanation and should optionally be suitable for controlled drug release of embedded growth factors to enhance nerve regeneration. Silk fibroin (SF) is a biocompatible and slowly biodegradable biomaterial with excellent mechanical properties that could meet the above stated requirements. SF material (films) supported the adherence and metabolic activity of PC 12 cells, and, in combination with nerve growth factor (NGF), supported neurite outgrowth during PC12 cell differentiation. NGF-loaded SF-NC were prepared from aqueous solutions of NGF and SF (20%, w/w), which were air-dried or freeze-dried (freezing at -20 or -196 degrees C) in suitable molds. NGF release from the three differently prepared SF-NC was prolonged over at least 3 weeks, but the total amount released depended on the drying procedure of the NC. The potency of released NGF was retained within all formulations. Control experiments with differently dried NGF-lactose solutions did not evidence marked protein aggregation (SEC, HPLC), loss of ELISA-reactivity or PC12 cell bioactivity. This study encourages the further exploitation of SF-NC for growth factor delivery and evaluation in peripheral nerve repair. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Adenovirus BMP2-induced osteogenesis in combination with collagen
   carriers
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Adenovirus BMP2 gene therapy has potential of a robust endogenous BMP2 production, while circumventing many of the problems currently associated with recombinant BMP2. The study objective was to determine and compare the ability of adenovirus BMP2 ex vivo gene therapy in combination with three types of collagen carriers to release BMP2 in vitro and to induce heterotopic bone formation in vivo. Human CD45-negative bone marrow cells were ex vivo transduced with a chimeric Ad5F35BMP2. The bioactivity of BMP2 produced by the transduced cells without a carrier, or in combination with three types of collagen carriers (injectable gel, microporous sponge, collagen-mineral composite) was measured and compared to rhBMP2. The heterotopic osteoinductivity assay was performed in immunocompromised NOD/SCID mice. A statistically significant decrease in the amount of rhBMP2 and adenoviral BMP2 released in vitro from the collagen-mineral composite carrier was noted (21% and 12%, respectively), whereas the amounts of rhBMP2 and adenoviral BMP2 released from the gel or sponge carriers were comparable. In vivo, 14 days post-implantation, no bone was formed consistently in groups with the empty Ad5F35HM4 control vector. New bone formation was evident radiographically and histologically in all groups with the Ad51735BMP2-transduced cells irrespective of the presence or absence of a carrier. The presence of a carrier resulted in osteogenesis limited to the implantation site, and was most pronounced for solid (sponge, composite) carriers. The physical characteristics of the carrier determined the new bone spatial distribution at the site. Solid carriers reduced the clearance of AD5F35-transduced cells by the host immune cells. Adenoviral ex vivo BMP2 gene therapy in combination with collagen carriers with distinct physical characteristics offers the prospects of adjusting this approach to optimally match the specific therapeutic requirements.

TI THE BEHAVIOR OF RAT TOOTH GERM CELLS ON
   3-HYDROXYL-BUTYRATE-CO-3-HYDROXY-HEXANOATE (PHBHHx) MEMBRANES
SO BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-APPLICATIONS BASIS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Copolymers of 3-hydroxyvalerate ( HV) and 3-hydroxyhexanoate (HHx) membranes are a new family of biomaterials for tissue engineering applications. The object of this study is to investigate the behavior of rat tooth germ cells on various 3-hydroxyl-butyrate-co-3-hydroxy-hexanoate (PHBHHx) membranes. In this study, PHBHHx membranes from three thin-film processes were used. PHBHHx membranes with different surface morphologies were prepared by phase inversion, electrospinning, and hot pressing. The morphologies of the PHBHHx membranes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Tooth germ cells were isolated from four-day-old Wistar rats. The cellular adhesion, proliferation and viability were determined by SEM, BrdU (5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine) and MTT (3-[4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Thiazolyl blue) assay. In addition, the adherent behavior of tooth germ cells on various surface structures of PHBHHx was observed under a fluorescence microscope after staining of the cytoskeletal filamentous actin of the cells. It was found that cell compatibility of the PHBHHx membranes made from the phase inversion method (p-PHBHHx) was better than that of the other PHBHHx membranes. The results also revealed that tooth germ cells cultured on the PHBHHx membranes with porous surface structure were well spread relative to those on the fibrous structure of PHBHHx membranes. Therefore, PHBHHx membranes with a porous surface structure can encourage either cell adhesion or cell proliferation. PHBHHx membranes with a porous morphology satisfy biomaterial requirements for a scaffold for tooth regeneration.

TI Nanostructured HA crystals up-regulate FGF-2 expression and activity in
   microvascular endothelium promoting angiogenesis
SO BONE
AB In mineralized tissue the process of angiogenesis is required for normal osteogenesis during bone repair and in reconstructive and substitutive surgery, for proper biomaterial/tissue integration. Nanotechnologies have been proposed to improve the compatibility of biomaterials for use in orthopaedic and reconstructive surgery (e.g., nanocrystals).
   The aim of this study was to determine the effect of nanostructured hydroxyapatite (HA) on angiogenesis. Microvascular endothelial cell survival, proliferation and migration, crucial events in the angiogenic process, were evaluated together with cytoskeleton and biochemical signalling markers.
   Induction of migration, metalloproteinase (MMP-2) and focal adhesion Kinase (FAK) activity documented the ability of HA nanocrystals to stimulate capillary endothelium toward an angiogenic phenotype. HA concentrations, ranging from 2 to 10 mu g/ml, promoted endothelium survival and proliferation, preserved alpha(v)beta(3)-integrirr localization, stimulated beta-actin reorganization and Akt phosphorylation (98% vs control). Immunoassays for key signalling pathways in angiogenesis (i.e., endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2)) demonstrated that HA increased their expression. Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis confirmed that HA nanocrystals exposure up-regulated FGF-2 mRNA by 6 fold and increased 18 kDa protein isoform by 40%. HA enhanced cell responsiveness to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in terms of NOS activity (1.5 fold over control), increasing the ability of microvascular endothelium to differentiate into capillary-like structures when grown in 3D fibrin gel.
   In conclusion our data document the proangiogenic properties of HA nanocrystals. This material stimulates endothelial cell functions and biochemical pathways to an extent similar to VEGF, and primes them to VEGF stimulation, leading to differentiation in pseudocapillary formations in 3D matrices.

TI Improvement of Anselme's adhesion model for evaluating human osteoblast
   response to peptide-grafted titanium surfaces
SO BONE
AB Investigations on the relationships between the properties of biomaterial surfaces and cell adhesion/proliferation processes have recently gained increasing interest. To describe the behaviour of cells adhering and proliferating over different types of (and/or differently treated) substrates, some mathematical models have been also suggested in literature; these models consider both the dependence of cell adhesion/proliferation over time, and the influence of substrate morphology in allowing (or even hampering) cell attachment.
   Major developments in the biochemical functionalization of the materials used for the production of endosseous devices have been achieved; the ability of the so-called "biomimetic" surfaces to promote cell adhesion, thus favoring the osseointegration process, is already well acknowledged.
   The aim of this study was to formulate a mathematical model for osteoblast adhesion, mediated by an adhesion peptide (sequence 351-359 mapped on the Human Vitronectin Protein) covalently grafted to a titanium-based surface. To assure a highly homogenous orientation of the peptide to cells, the "specific functionalization" strategy was properly designed.
   Enzymatic detachment assays allowed comparing osteoblast behaviour over three differently treated titanium substrates (i.e., oxidized, silanized, and peptide-grafted), thus determining how and how much the bioactive peptide can improve the strength of cell adhesion. The results confirmed the capacity of the peptide to increase cell adhesion and adhesion strength; moreover, the role of the peptide was described by a mathematical equation characterizing cells behaviour.

TI Potential of biowaste from the food industry as a biomass resource
SO ENGINEERING IN LIFE SCIENCES
AB The importance of biomass as a resource for energy production or as a chemical feedstock will increase significantly in the next decades. The amounts of biomass that can be used for non-food purposes however will be limited and its use will compete with other claims like food and feed production. In order to minimize such food-feed-fuel conflicts it is necessary to integrate all kinds of biowaste into a biomass economy. The food industry in particular might be a good candidate for assessment, since it produces inevitably large amounts of biogenic residues each year. The possibilities to use food processing residues for non-food purposes like bioenergy, biomaterial production, chemical feedstock or as animal feed are therefore discussed in more detail in this paper. It is shown that food processing residues represent a small but valuable biomass fraction that can be exploited in numerous ways. The most promising approach appears to be to design new microbial bioconversion processes as part of more complex biorefinery concepts.

TI Morphostructural analysis of human follicular stem cells on highly
   porous bone hydroxyapatite scaffold
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMMUNOPATHOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB In this study we investigated the in vitro behaviour, morphostructure and extracellular matrix synthesis of human dental follicular stem cells (hDFSCs) isolated from human dental bud, which resulted to be positive for mesenchymal markers (CD29, CD90, CD146 and CD166) by FACS analysis. Cells were analysed by light and electronic microscopy to evaluate their biological response either at week 1, that is before differentiation, or at weeks 3-6, when they had been cultured in osteogenic medium onto a highly porous natural scaffold material (Bio-Oss(R)). Microscopy analysis of primary culture cells showed they had a mesenchymal stem cell-like morphostructure, spindle shaped, similar to the culture of mesenchymal stem cells derived from adult bone marrow. Also, after osteogenic differentiation, these analyses indicate typical osteoblast morphostructure and reveale a tri-dimensional organization of the cells and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in close contact with biomaterial. This approach would allow to personalize the scaffold for bone tissue engineering in order to accelerate the process of osteogenesis.

TI Influence of cyclodextrins on the proliferation of HaCaT keratinocytes
   in vitro
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical agents can be greatly improved by encapsulation within, or covalent attachment to, a biomaterial carrier. Drug delivery systems must deliver the necessary amount of drug to the targeted site for a necessary period of time, both efficiently and precisely. Various kinds of high-performance biomaterials are being constantly developed for this purpose. Cyclodextrins are potential candidates for such a role, because of their ability to alter physical, chemical, and biological properties of guest molecules through the formation of inclusion complexes. The alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrins are widely used natural cyclodextrins, consisting of six, seven, and eight D-glucopyranose residues, respectively, linked by -1,4 glycosidic bonds into a macro cycle. Each cyclodextrin has its own ability to form inclusion complexes with specific guests, an ability, which depends on a proper fit of the guest molecule into the hydrophobic cyclodextrin cavity. The most common pharmaceutical application of cyclodextrins is to enhance the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of drug molecules. Such kinds of ligand-receptor complexes can be used for different applications, e.g., for a transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) or in biofunctional textiles. The aim of this study was the investigation of the influence of the different cyclodextrins on the cell proliferation using HaCaT keratinocytes as an in vitro test system. Moreover, the study was performed to find harmless and nontoxic cyclodextrin concentrations for dermal applications. By means of different independent in vitro tests could be confirmed that alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrins in concentrations up to 0.1% (w/v) do not show any antiproliferative influence on HaCaT keratinocytes. Sometimes even proliferative effects could be found. However, all used cyclodextrins (besides gamma-cyclodextrin and its derivatives) in concentrations of 0.5 and 1% (w/v), respectively, exert a cytotoxic influence on the proliferation of HaCaT keratinocytes. On the basis of these findings, the following rank order of cyclodextrins regarding their cytotoxicity was proposed: M-beta-CD > beta-CD > HP-beta-CD > alpha-CD > (gamma-CD). It could be confirmed that beta-CD and M-beta-CD trigger the activity of the effectors caspases -3 and -7. A significant increase of LDH release could be found for P-CD and methyl-beta-CD in concentrations of 0.5 and 1% (w/v). The calculated cytotoxicity amounted 45 and 79%, respectively. The measurements of the interleukins IL-6 and IL-8 confirmed the findings of the proliferation assays as well as the LDH measurements. These findings may provide further rationale to the use of CDs in topical formulations for dermal and transdermal drug delivery or as raw material to functionalize textiles for medical applications.

TI Accelerated calcification in electrically conductive polymer composites
   comprised of poly(epsilon-caprolactone), polyaniline, and bioactive
   mesoporous silicon
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB In this study the fabrication and characterization of an electrically conductive composite material comprised of poly(F-caprolactone) (PCL), polyaniline(TM)) (PANi), and bioactive mesoporous silicon (BioSilicon is discussed. The influence of PANi and silicon on calcium phosphate induction was assessed via ex vitro calcification analyses (by acellular simulated body fluid (SBF) exposure) both with and without electrical bias. Acceleration of calcium phosphate formation is one possible desirable feature of "smart" synthetic scaffolds for selected orthopedic-relevant applications. In addition, electrical stability assays were performed in growth medium (DMEM) to determine the stability of such structures to bias in an authentic electrolyte during a typical cell experiment. The cytocompatibility of the composites was evaluated in vitro using human kidney fibroblasts (HEK 293) cell proliferation assays, along with more orthopedically relevant mesenchymal stem cells from mouse stroma. Importantly, these composites demonstrate accelerated calcification in SBF when electrical bias is applied cathodically to the scaffold. Furthermore, these scaffolds exhibit noncytotoxic behavior in the presence of fibroblasts over an 8-day culture period, and attachment of stromal cells to the semiconducting scaffold was directly imaged via scanning electron microscopy. Overall, these results suggest that materials of this type of composition have potential merit as a biomaterial. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Cell-surface interactions of rat tooth germ cells on various
   biomaterials
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB This is the first study to explore the effect of biomaterial on tooth germ cell adhesion and proliferation in vitro. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of cell-surface interactions of tooth germ cells on biomaterials with various surface hydrophilicities. The biomaterials used in this study included polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol; EVAL), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Cell morphology was observed by photomicroscopy. Cell growth was assaved with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction activity and the characteristic expression of amelogenin and collaa I,,en type I in tooth germ cells was investigated using immunocytochemistry. The results indicated that adhesion and proliferation of tooth germ cells to biomaterials with moderate hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity was superior compared to most hydrophobic material PVDF or most hydrophilic material PVA in this study. Cellular adhesion and proliferation was evident on all tested biomaterials except PVA. The cell spheroids on PVA appeared not to be proliferated and remained as well as reattachable to tissue culture plates. In conclusion, biomaterials with moderate hydrophilicity are suitable for adhesion and proliferation of tooth germ cells. The material PVA may be a good biomaterial for maintaining tooth germ cells in three-dimensional biological restoration. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Natural composite of wood as replacement material for ostechondral bone
   defects
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS
AB Deciduous wood, birch, pretreated by a technique combining heat and water vapor was applied for the reconstruction of bone defects in the knee joint of rabbits. It was observed that wood showed characteristic properties to be incorporated by the host bone during observation time of 4, 8, and 20 weeks. The natural channel structure of wood served as a porous scaffold, allowing host bone growth as small islets into the wood implants. The other properties of heat-treated wood, such as bioactivity, good handling properties, and sufficient biomechanical properties, might be additional favorable factors for the application of wood as a natural composite material for bone and cartilage repair. At the interface of the surfaces of wood and living bone, bonding occurred. The Chemical Interface Model for bonding bone to wood consists of the reactive ions, such as hydroxyl groups -OH, and covalent bonding as well as hydrogen bonding, which originate from both wood and bone. The bone tissue trauma, with its reactive Ca2+ and PO43- ions, proteins, and collagen, available for interaction at ionic and nanolevel, are associated with the complicated chemistry in the cellular response of the early bone healing process. It was concluded that heat-treated wood acted like a porous biomaterial scaffold, allowing ongrowth and ingrowth of bone and cartilage differentiation on its surface, and demonstrating osteoconductive contact, bonding at the interface.

TI Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species: Implications for cardiovascular
   device engineering
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS
AB The development of medical devices for cardiovascular applications has suffered due to lack of understanding of why vascular wall cells act nonphysiologically when exposed to biomaterials. One possible reason might be the chemical environment associated with cardiovascular disease. An improved understanding of cellular and subcellular mechanisms may assist in future device design to account for the disease environment. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) are produced through normal cellular metabolism and are rendered harmless by enzymatic systems. However, during a disease process, these systems may act aberrantly, and either fail to convert ROS and RNS to harmless substances or by producing more oxidants. There is indirect evidence that the implantation of biomedical materials may also be responsible for the triggering of these aberrant pathways that may lead to the eventual failure of the device. The understanding of how the vascular environment may be changed at the subcellular level by the presence of a biomaterial is critical. In the following pages, we hope to review the current thinking within vascular biology regarding ROS and RNS, how they are measured, and how they may impact vascular cells.

TI Collagen-apatite nanocomposite membranes for guided bone regeneration
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS
AB Collagen-apatite nanocomposite is regarded as a potential biomaterial because of its composition and structure, which are similar to those of human hard tissues. However, there have been few investigations of its mechanical and biological benefits in direct comparison with a collagen equivalent. Herein, we successfully produced a biomedical membrane made of a nanocomposite, and systemically evaluated the mechanical, chemical, and biological properties of the nanocomposite in comparison with those of pure collagen. The results showed that significant improvements were achieved by the nanocomposite approach, particularly in terms of the mechanical strength and chemical stability. The present findings point to the potential usefulness of the collagen-apatite nanocomposite membrane in the field of guided bone regeneration (GBR). (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Laparoscopic approach to recurrent incisional hernia repair: A 3-year
   experience
SO JOURNAL OF LAPAROENDOSCOPIC & ADVANCED SURGICAL TECHNIQUES
AB Background: Incisional hernias are one of the most frequent complications of open abdominal surgery. The incidence of relapses after a conventional repair procedure is higher in recurrent than in primary cases (30%-50% vs. 11%-20%). The laparoscopic approach can prevent the complications associated with the conventional approach when dealing with recurrent incisional hernias. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of laparoscopic treatment in such cases.
   Materials and Methods: We prospectively analyzed data from 41 consecutive patients with recurrent incisional hernias, who submitted to a laparoscopic repair procedure with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene Dual Mesh (Gore-Tex((R)) Dual Mesh((R)) Plus Biomaterial; W. L. Gore 8 Associates) from December 2001 to December 2004. All of the patients underwent clinical follow-up at 1, 6, and 12 months and then yearly. An ultrasound scan of the abdominal wall was performed at 6 and 12 months after the procedure. The parameters considered for the analysis were: mesh size, operating time, hospital stay, postoperative complications, and recurrences.
   Results: The defects were usually localized along midline laparotomies. The mean mesh size was 400 cm(2), the mean operating time was 68 minutes, and the mean length of hospital stay was 2.7 days. Complications were encountered in 17% of patients. The mean follow-up was 38 months (range, 18-54). Recurrence was reported in 1 case only (2.4%), which occurred within the first 6 months after the operation.
   Conclusions: The laparoscopic repair of recurrent incisional hernia seems to be an effective alternative to the conventional approach, as it can give lower recurrence and complication rates.

TI Mechanical properties of porous crosslinked poly(ethyl-acrylate) for
   tissue engineering
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Scaffolds of crosslinked poly(ethyl-acrylate) were prepared by polymerizing the monomer over a template made from Nylon fabrics compressed with different pressures; cylindrical pores in three dimensions of around 80 microns were obtained. Sample porosity and their mechanical, thermal and morphological properties were measured. Different models were analysed with the finite element method, studying the effect of the pore size and geometry on the effective properties of the scaffolds. The diameter of the pore did not influence the effective mechanical properties of the scaffold. The densification on compression of the scaffold due to pore collapse was identified on the stress-strain curve, and a correlation between the onset of this process on that curve and scaffold porosity was established.

TI Absorbable collagen sponge combined with recombinant human basic
   fibroblast growth factor promotes nerve regeneration in rat sciatic
   nerve
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB Recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (rhbFGF) is a peptide with many bioactivities such as promoting proliferation and migration of various cells. It plays an important role in neuroprotection and enhancement of nerve regeneration. Due to its short half-life in the body, local administration by injection is limited. To prolong the bioactivity of rhbFGF and to enhance its biological effects, absorbable collagen sponge was used as matrixes and carriers for controlled release of rhbFGF. The effects of rhbFGF soaked into an absorbable collagen sponge (rhbFGF/ACS) for the repair of rat sciatic nerve injury were evaluated. The functional, electrophysiological and histological examinations demonstrate the treatment with rhbFGF/ACS can enhance rat sciatic nerve repair, and its effectiveness is better than free rhbFGF alone. It is concluded the rhbFGF/ACS is a promising biomaterial to improve the repair and regeneration of sciatic nerve injury.

TI Microvasculatory reaction of skeletal muscle to Ti-15Mo in comparison to
   well-established titanium alloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB Beta-titanium alloys such as Ti-15Mo are increasingly utilized for orthopaedic implant applications because of their excellent corrosion resistance and low elastic modulus. Particularly in osteosynthesis, where the biomaterial stands in direct contact to soft tissue, undesirable biologic reactions may have severe consequences especially in the vulnerable state of trauma and added iatrogenic damage to the microvascular system. In a comparative study we therefore assessed in vivo nutritive perfusion and leukocytic response of striated muscle to the biomaterials Ti-15Mo, Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-7Nb, thereby drawing conclusions on their short term inflammatory potential. Utilizing the well established skinfold chamber preparation in the hamster and intravital fluorescence microscopy, we could not demonstrate any significant discrepancies between the three alloys. All metals induced an initial moderate inflammatory response in skeletal muscle microcirculation. While recuperation of animals treated with Ti-15Mo and Ti-6Al-7Nb was prompt, we documented a slightly more sluggish recovery of Ti-6Al-4V treated animals. A gross toxicity was not observed for any of the alloys. Conclusively, Ti-15Mo, Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-7Nb induce an only transient inflammatory answer of the striated muscle microvascular system. Our results indicate that on the microvascular level the tested bulk Ti-alloys do not cause enduring biologic impairment in muscle.

TI Human osteoblast cell spreading and vinculin expression upon biomaterial
   surfaces
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR HISTOLOGY
AB Any biomaterial implanted within the human body is influenced by the interactions that take place between its surface and the surrounding biological milieu. These interactions are known to influence the tissue interface dynamic, and thus act to emphasize the need to study cell-surface interactions as part of any biomaterial design process. The work described here investigates the relationship between human osteoblast attachment, spreading and focal contact formation on selected surfaces using immunostaining and digital image processing for vinculin, a key focal adhesion component. Our observations show that a relationship exists between levels of cell attachment, the degree of vinculin-associated plaque formation and biocompatibility. It also suggests that cell adhesion is not indicative of how supportive a substrate is to cell spreading, and that cell spreading does not correlate with focal contact formation.

TI A porous bioactive titanium implant for spinal interbody fusion: an
   experimental study using a canine model
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-SPINE
AB Object. Porous biomaterials with adequate pore structure and appropriate mechanical properties are expected to provide a new generation of devices for spinal interbody fusion because of their potential to eliminate bone grafting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fusion characteristics of porous bioactive titanium implants using a canine anterior interbody fusion model.
   Methods. Porous titanium implants sintered with volatile spacer particles (porosity 50%, average pore size 303 mu m, compressive strength 116.3 MPa) were subjected to chemical and thermal treatments that give a bioactive microporous titania layer on the titanium surface (BT implant). Ten adult female beagle dogs underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion at L6-7 using either BT implants or nontreated (NT) implants, followed by posterior spinous process wiring and facet screw fixation. Radiographic evaluations were performed at 1, 2, and 3 months postoperatively using X-ray fluoroscopy. Animals were killed 3 months postoperatively, and fusion status was evaluated by manual palpation and histological examination.
   Results. Interbody fusion was confirmed in all five dogs in the BT group and three of five dogs in the NT group. Histological examination demonstrated a large amount of new bone formation with marrowlike tissue in the BT implants and primarily fibrous tissue formation in the NT implants.
   Conclusions. Bioactive treatment effectively enhanced the fusion ability of the porous titanium implants. These findings, coupled with the appropriate mechanical properties in load-bearing conditions, indicate that these porous bioactive titanium implants represent a new generation of biomaterial for spinal interbody fusion.

TI Repair of porcine articular cartilage defect with a biphasic
   osteochondral composite
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH
AB Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has been recently used to treat cartilage defects. Partly because of the success of mosaicplasty, a procedure that involves the implantation of native osteochondral plugs, it is of potential significance to consider the application of ACI in the form of biphasic osteochondral composites. To test the clinical applicability of such composite construct, we repaired osteochondral defect with ACI at low cell-seeding density on a biphasic scaffold, and combined graft harvest and implantation in a single surgery. We fabricated a biphasic cylindrical porous plug of DL-poly-lactide-co-glycolide, with its lower body impregnated with beta-tricalcium phosphate as the osseous phase. Osteochondral defects were surgically created at the weight-bearing surface of femoral condyles of Lee-Sung mini-pigs. Autologous chondrocytes isolated from the cartilage were seeded into the upper, chondral phase of the plug, which was inserted by press-fitting to fill the defect. Defects treated with cell-free plugs served as control. Outcome of repair was examined 6 months after surgery. In the osseous phase, the biomaterial retained in the center and cancellous bone formed in the periphery, integrating well with native subchondral bone with extensive remodeling, as depicted on X-ray roentgenography by higher radiolucency. In the chondral phase, collagen type II immunohistochemistry and Safranin O histological staining showed hyaline cartilage regeneration in the experimental group, whereas only fibrous tissue formed in the control group. On the International Cartilage Repair Society Scale, the experimental group had higher mean scores in surface, matrix, cell distribution, and cell viability than control, but was comparable with the control group in subchondral bone and mineralization. Tensile stress-relaxation behavior determined by uni-axial indentation test revealed similar creep property between the surface of the experimental specimen and native cartilage, but not the control specimen. Implanted autologous chondrocytes could survive and could yield hyaline-like cartilage in vivo in the biphasic biomaterial construct. Pre-seeding of osteogenic cells did not appear to be necessary to regenerate subchondral bone. (c) 2007 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Clinical evaluation of the combination of anorganic bovine-derived
   peptide (P-15) in particulate and hydrogel form as a bone replacement
   graft material in human periodontal osseous defects: 6-month reentry
   controlled clinical study
SO JOURNAL OF PERIODONTOLOGY
AB Background: This prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial study compared the clinical outcomes of the biomaterial anorganic bovine-derived hydroxyapatite matrix/cell-binding peptide (ABM/P-15) as a biocompatible hydrogel carrier consisting of carboxymethylcellulose and glycerol or in particulate form when used as a bone replacement graft in the treatment of human periodontal infrabony defects.
   Methods: Nineteen patients with advanced chronic periodontitis were recruited. All patients had at least two non-adjacent intrabony osseous defects 3 mm after completion of cause-related periodontal therapy. The surgical procedures included access flaps for root instrumentation and filling the defect with ABM/P-15 in hydrogel or particulate form. Reentry access flap surgery was performed at 6 months. Changes in soft and hard tissue outcome measurements between baseline and 6 months were evaluated in ail defects.
   Results: At 6 months, no significant differences between ABM/P-15 hydrogel and ABM/P-15 particulate were demonstrated for the amount of defect fill (3.10 +/- 0.85 mm [75.0%] versus 3.09 +/- 1.11 mm [73.7%], respectively) or defect resolution (85.8% versus 81.9%). Changes in soft tissue clinical outcomes did not show significant differences between the treatments.
   Conclusion: This trial failed to demonstrate superiority of the novel ABM/P-15 hydrogel therapeutic modality over the standard ABM/P-15 particulate graft in the treatment of intrabony periodontal defects.

TI Anorganic bone matrix retrieved 14 years after a sinus augmentation
   procedure: A histologic and histomorphometric evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF PERIODONTOLOGY
AB Background: Anorganic bone matrix (ABM) is reported to have osteoconductive properties. No inflammatory or adverse responses have been reported when this material is used in sinus augmentation procedures. ABM is said to be a bioabsorbable biomaterial, but histologic data seem to suggest that the resorption process is slow. Long-term histologic data in humans are lacking. The aim of this case report was to evaluate the bone response to ABM used in maxillary sinus augmentation and retrieved 14 years after surgery.
   Methods: Titanium dental implants were inserted in two sinuses augmented with ABM. The implants were osseointegrated and functioned well for 14 years. After this period of loading, the connecting screw of one of the implants inserted in the left maxilla broke, and it was necessary to remove the implant. A bone core of the augmented area was harvested separately during the implant removal.
   Results: A very high quantity of mature, compact bone and a small percentage of residual grafted bio-material were found. About 5% to 7% of the bone was undergoing remodeling. In most cases, residual ABM particles were surrounded by marrow spaces. In other areas, lamellar bone was found in tight contact with the particle surfaces. Histomorphometry showed that the mean amount of mature, compact bone was 71.0% +/- 2.28%, the mean amount of ABM was 22.1% +/- 3.18%, and the mean amount of marrow spaces was 11.2% +/- 5.42%.
   Conclusions: ABM seemed to resorb very slowly; after 14 years, only a small quantity of residual grafted particles was present. ABM is an effective graft material for sinus augmentation procedures. Vital, mature bone was formed and maintained over a long period with no chronic inflammatory cell inflltrate, foreign body response, or other adverse effects.

AB Following our recent study on the fractionation, characterization, and model adsorption of mucins derived from bovine salivary glands (BSM), porcine stomach scrapings (PGM), and human whole saliva (MG1), we here present a microscopic evaluation of the interactions between mucin-coated substrates and human neutrophils. Our results show that surfacecoating with BSM, PGM, and MG1 can be effectively used to suppress the adhesion of neutrophils to a polymeric model biomaterial (Thermanox). Neutrophil morphologies found on Thermanox substrates coated with mucins resemble those observed for nonactivated neutrophils found in circulation. Notably, low neutrophil adhesion can be obtained at a significantly lower coating concentration (0.125 mg/mL) for the compositionally complex MG1 mucin than for the relatively pure BSM and PGM mucins (I mg/mL). Furthermore, since coating at a low BSM and PGM concentration (0.25 mg/mL) results in higher cell counts and more spread cells than in the high-concentration case, we suggest that dense mucin surface packing is critical for good coating performance. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates how mucins from three different sources, of different compositional and structural status, efficiently can be used to suppress neutrophil adhesion and activation. This finding makes them potent candidates for use as biomaterial coatings.

TI Use of surgisis for abdominal wall Reconstruction/Closure in battlefield
   casualties during operation Iraqi freedom
SO MILITARY MEDICINE
AB A case series and discussion based on experiences gained during Operation Iraqi Freedom are presented. The Army previously published an article on the use of Gore-Tex mesh in the staged closure of open abdominal wounds. We thought that use of a biomaterial could shorten the overall course of abdominal closure and improve outcomes. This is mainly a "proof of concept" type of study. Although class I data are not presented, a useful concept is discussed. To our knowledge, no other report of the use of biomaterials for battle casualties has been published. Several issues that are faced by the military medical system are presented. The use of Surgisis (lyophilized porcine small intestinal submucosa; Cook Biotech, West Lafayette, Indiana) in the described setting is presented as one possible solution.

TI Novel therapy for hearing loss: Delivery of insulin-like growth factor 1
   to the cochlea using gelatin hydrogel
SO OTOLOGY & NEUROTOLOGY
AB Hypothesis: Local application of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-1) via a biodegradable hydrogel after onset of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) can attenuate functional and histologic damage.
   Background: The biodegradable gelatin hydrogel makes a complex with drugs by static electric charges and releases drugs by degradation of gelatin polymers. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of local rhIGF-1 application via hydrogels before noise exposure for prevention of NIHL.
   Methods: First, we used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure human IGF-1 concentrations in the cochlear fluid after placing a hydrogel containing rhIGF-1 onto the round window membrane of guinea pigs. Second, the functionality and the histology of guinea pig cochleae treated with local rhIGF-1 I application at different concentrations after noise exposure were examined. Control animals were treated with a hydrogel immersed in physiologic saline alone.
   Results: The results revealed sustained delivery of rhIGF-1 into the cochlear fluid via the hydrogel. The measurement of auditory brainstem responses demonstrated that local rhIGF-1 treatment significantly reduced the threshold elevation from noise. Histologic analysis exhibited increased survival of outer hair cells by local rhlGF-1 application through the hydrogel.
   Conclusion: These findings indicate that local rhlGF-1 treatment via gelatin hydrogels is effective for treatment of NIHL.

TI Stabilization of growth factors relevant to wound healing by a plant
   cell wall biomaterial
SO PLANTA MEDICA
AB Stabilization of growth factors in a wound environment is critical to the wound healing process. Here we report on the stabilization of key growth factors by a unique plant cell wall biomaterial. MicroSheets are clear cell wall fragments isolated from the non-living water storage cells in the pulp or inner gel of Aloe vera L., which has widely been used for wound healing. It was found that MicroSheets bind to a subset of heparin binding growth factors including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), two key growth factors in the wound healing process. The binding of bFGF and KGF to MicroSheets was inhibited by heparin and also by a pectic substance isolated from the MicroSheets, indicating that the binding was mediated by this pectic component of the MicroSheet. The binding protected the growth factors against protease digestion. Furthermore, the protective effect was also demonstrated with KGF against digestion by wound fluids and by measuring the biological activity. Thus, these results showed that MicroSheets can stabilize certain critical growth factors in wounds and thereby promote the healing process. Incorporation of a material like MicroSheets provides an important functional element in wound dressings, i.e., growth factor stabilization.

   cyanoacrylate-telechelic polyisobutylenes II: copolymerization of
   three-arm star cyanoacrylatetelechelic polyisobutylene with ethyl
   cyanoacrylate
SO POLYMERS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES
AB This research concerned the synthesis and characterization of novel conetworks containing polyisobutylene (PIB) and polyethyl-2-cyanoacrylate [poly(Et-CA)] sequences. The syntheses involved the copolymerization of CA-telechelic three-arm star PlB [circle divide(PIB-CA)(3)] with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Et-CA) mediated by nucleophiles or by living tissue (fresh eggs). The conetworks were characterized by swelling in hexanes, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and acetone, and the results indicate co-continuous PlB and poly(Et-CA) domains. The conetworks exhibit two T(g)s indicating phase-separation between PIB and poly(Et-CA). The outstanding oxidative resistance of the conetworks was demonstrated by exposure to concentrated nitric acid. The tensile strengths, moduli, and elongations of a series of conetworks with different overall compositions were investigated and the findings interpreted in terms of covalently linked rubbery and glassy domains. AFM also suggests the presence of phase-separated rubbery and glassy domains. DMTA spectra of a circle divide(PIB-CA)3 homonetwork, and circle divide(PIB-CA)(3)/Et-CA conetworks were analyzed and interpreted in terms of coexisting rubbery and glassy domains. Observations made during the exposure of circle divide(PIB-CA)(3)/Et-CA mixtures to proteinaceous tissue, in combination with characterization data, were used to propose a structural model for the conetworks.

TI An integrin-specific collagen-mimetic peptide approach for optimizing
   Hep3B liver cell adhesion, proliferation, and cellular functions
SO TISSUE ENGINEERING
AB This study focused on mimicking collagen structurally and biologically using various peptide sequences toward realizing an artificial collagen-like biomaterial. Collagen-mimetic peptides (CMPs) incorporating integrin-specific glycine-phenylalanine-hydroxyproline-glycine-glutamate-arginine (GFOGER) sequence from residues 502 to 507 of collagen alpha(1)(I) were used as a bioadhesive matrix and grafted onto poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co3- hydroxyvalerate) microspheres to optimize cell adhesion, proliferation, and functions. Cell recognition of these biomolecules appeared to be conformation dependent, with the CMP1 of higher triple helix stability being preferred. Absence of the GFOGER hexapeptide in the CMP1' and CMP2' caused an adverse effect on the level of cell adhesion (< 10%). The GFOGER-containing triple-helical CMPs effectively inhibited cell adhesion to collagen in a competition assay. The cell-adhesion activity of the CMP1 was approximately 50% of that of collagen. The cell spreading on the CMP1 was comparable with that observed on collagen. The presence of the CMP1 promoted cell attachment and spreading on the microspheres and extensive cell proliferation and bridging. Slower cell proliferation was observed on the blank microspheres. Live-dead assay showed that most cells are viable after 10-day culture. The presence of CMP1 on the microspheres maintained the albumin secretion and P-450 activity levels of the liver cells for up to 14 days. Our results established the potential of CMP1 to create a collagenlike microenvironment for optimizing cellular responses for liver tissue engineering.

TI Surface modification of Ti dental implants by Nd: YVO4 laser irradiation
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Surface modifications have been applied in endosteal bone devices in order to improve the osseointegration through direct contact between neoformed bone and the implant without an intervening soft tissue layer. Surface characteristics of titanium implants have been modified by addictive methods, such as metallic titanium, titanium oxide and hydroxyapatite powder plasma spray, as well as by subtractive methods, such as acid etching, acid etching associated with sandblasting by either AlO2 or TiO2, and recently by laser ablation. Surface modification for dental and medical implants can be obtained by using laser irradiation technique where its parameters like repetition rate, pulse energy, scanning speed and fluency must be taken into accounting to the appropriate surface topography. Surfaces of commercially pure Ti (cpTi) were modified by laser Nd:YVO4 in nine different parameters configurations, all under normal atmosphere. The samples were characterized by SEM and XRD refined by Rietveld method. The crystalline phases alpha Ti, beta Ti, Ti6O, Ti3O and TiO were formed by the melting and fast cooling processes during irradiation. The resulting phases on the irradiated surface were correlated with the laser beam parameters: The aim of the present work was to control titanium oxides formations in order to improve implants osseointegration by using a laser irradiation technique which is of great importance to biomaterial devices due to being a clean and reproducible process.

TI Biomaterial culture conditions impacting the performance of a PAM
   fluorometry based aquatic phytotoxicity assay
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB An aquatic phytotoxicity assay, based on the principles of pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry has recently been developed and validated under laboratory conditions. Characteristics of the assay include the use of photosynthesising biomaterial, most frequently whole organism microalgae. The instrument employs light probing measurements to monitor chlorophyll fluorescence signals emitted by the biomaterial component. These characteristics could leave assay performance susceptible to interference by minor variations in biomaterial treatment and culture conditions prior to testing. This study investigates assay performance in response to variations in two microalgae culture parameters; short-term light history (24 h) prior to testing and the sterility of long-term culture conditions.
   Light history of the four microalgal species tested significantly impacted their toxicity response, as measured with the assay. Light treatments of 5 mu mol photons m(-2)s(-1) produced the highest photosystem II quantum yields (Phi(II)) whilst higher light intensities resulted in an inverse relationship between Phi(II) and the measured toxicity response (inhibition (%) of photochemistry).
   Of the two microalgal cultures tested, sterility of culture conditions significantly impacted the performance of the green freshwater algae, Chlorella vulgaris as assay biomaterial. On average 1 mu g L-1 diuron inhibited photochemistry 2.6% less in axenically cultured C vulgaris compared with non-axenically maintained cultures.
   This investigation series contributes valuable quality assurance data towards microalgal based PAM fluorometry assays and emphasises the importance of such investigations if new biorecognition systems are to be accredited and/or routinely incorporated for biomonitoring purposes.

TI Capillary-induced contact guidance
SO LANGMUIR
AB Topographical features are known to impose capillary forces on liquid droplets, and this phenomenon is exploited in applications such as printing, coatings, textiles and microfluidics. Surface topographies also influence the behavior of biological cells (i.e., contact guidance), with implications ranging from medicine to agriculture. An accurate physical description of how cells detect and respond to surface topographies is necessary in order to move beyond a purely heuristic approach to optimizing the topographies of biomaterial interfaces. Here, we have used a combination of Langmuir-Blodgett lithography and nanoimprinting to generate a range of synthetic microstructured surfaces with grooves of subcellular dimensions in order to investigate the influence of capillary forces on the biological process of contact guidance. The physical-chemical properties of these surfaces were assessed by measuring the anisotropic spreading of sessile water droplets. Having established the physical properties of each surface, we then investigated the influence of capillary forces on the processes of cellular contact guidance in biological organisms, using mammalian osteoblasts and germinating fungal spores as tester organisms. Our results demonstrate that capillary effects are present in topographical contact guidance and should therefore be considered in any physical model that seeks to predict how cells will respond to a particular surface topography.

TI Human adipose tissue-derived multipotent stem cells differentiate in
   vitro and in vivo into osteocyte-like cells
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB Cell-based therapies are used to treat bone defects. We recently described that human multipotent adipose-derived stem (hMADS) cells, which exhibit a normal karyotype, self renewal, and the maintenance of their differentiation properties, are able to differentiate into different lineages. Herein, we show that hMADS cells can differentiate into osteocyte-like cells. In the presence of a low amount of serum and EGF, hMADS cells express specific molecular markers, among which alkaline phosphatase, CBFA-1, osteocalcin, DMP1, PHEX, and podoplanin and develop functional gap-junctions. When loaded on a hardening injectable bone substitute (HIBS) biomaterial and injected subcutaneously into nude mice, hMADS cells develop mineralized woven bone 4 weeks after implantation. Thus hMADS cells represent a valuable toot for pharmacological and biological studies of osteoblast differentiation in vitro and bone development in vivo. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of NH3, O-2, and N-2 co-implantation on Cu out-diffusion and
   antimicrobial properties of copper plasma-implanted polyethylene
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Metal antibacterial reagents are effective in the enhancement of the antimicrobial properties of medical polymers. However, incorporation of metal antibacterial reagents into polymers using conventional methods usually results in unstable antimicrobial effects. Our previous research demonstrates that plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) can be used to effectively incorporate metal antibacterial reagents such as Cu into polyethylene (PE) in the near surface region up to several hundred nanometers without causing noticeable damage to the polymer matrix. In this work, various gases including NH3, O-2, and N-2 were plasma-implanted in concert with Cu plasma immersion ion implantation to study the effects of these gas species on the release rate of Cu from the substrate. Our experimental results reveal that the copper depth profiles are not affected significantly by NH3, O-2, or N-2 co-implantation and these gas elements have similar depth profiles as Cu. Chemical analyses demonstrate that polar functional C=O, C-O, C-N, C=N, and C  N bonds formed in the substrate play an important role in regulating Cu out-diffusion. Among the three gas species, N-2 shows the best effects in regulating Cu out-diffusion and produces the best long term antibacterial properties. The Cu retention and out-diffusion mechanism in the ion-implanted polyethylene is described. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Comparative in vitro study of of human osteoblast-like cells the
   proliferation and growth on various biomaterials
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB In vitro studies about the growth behavior of osteoblasts onto biornaterials is a basic knowledge and a screening method for the development and application of scaffolds in vivo. In this in vitro study human osteoblast-like (HOB) cells were cultured on seven different biornaterials used in dental and craniomaxillofacial surgery, respectively. The tested biornaterials were synthetic biodegradable (MacroPore (R), Ethisorb (R), PDS (R), Beriplastc (R) P) and nonbiodegradable polymers (Palacos (R)) as well as calcium phosphate cement (BoneSource (R)) and titanium. The cell proliferation and cell colonization were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and EZ4U-test. Statistical analysis were performed. HOB-like cells cultivated on Ethisorb showed the highest proliferation rate. The proliferation rate was statistically significant compared with Palacos, MacroPore, and BoneSource. Whereas, Beriplast, PDS, and titanium yielded lower proliferation rates. However, there was no statistically significant difference compared with Palacos, MacroPore, and BoneSource. SEM analysis showed no significant difference in individual cell features and cell colonization. But an infiltration and a growth of HOB-like cells throughout the porous structure of Ethisorb, which is formed by crossing fibers, is a striking different feature (macrotopography). This feature can explain the highest proliferation rate of Ethisorb. The results showed that HOB-like cells appear to be sensitive to substrate composition and topography. Moreover, the basis for further studies with such biomaterial/osteoblast constructs in vivo are provided. Further focusing points are developing techniques to fabricate three-dimensional porous biomaterial/cell constructs, studying the tissue reaction and the bone regeneration of such constructs compared with the use of autologous bone.

TI Dual requirements of extracellular matrix protein and chitosan for
   inducing adhesion contact evolution of esophageal epithelia
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB It has been recently shown that chitosan (CHI)/collagen prostheses induced epithelization at the esophagus site of animal model. However, little is known on the biophysical mechanisms of cell adhesion on CHI-based material pertaining to esophagus tissue engineering. In this study, the adhesion contact dynamics of porcine esophageal epithelial cells seeded on CHI surface is probed using confocal-reflectance interference contrast microscopy in conjunctiod with phase-contrast microscopy. First of all, cells fail to form any adhesion contact on either CHI or elastin (ES)-coated surface. On CHI coated with fibronectin (CHI-FN) or elastin (CHI-ES), strong adhesion contact of cells evolved over time until they reached a steady-state level. The initial cell deformation rates of cells on CHI-FN and CHI-ES are 0.0138 and 0.0151 min(-1), respectively. Interestingly, cells on fibronectin (IN) coated substrate transiently form strong adhesion contact and eventually undergo dead-hesion. Moreover, the steady-state adhesion energy of epithehal cells on CHI-FN is 1.73 and 148 times larger than that on CHI-ES and FN, respectively. The actin of cells on CHI-FN transforms from microfilament meshes at cell periphery to stress fibers throughout the cytoplasm during cell seeding. At the same time, vinculin staining demonstrated the evolution of focal adhesion complexes in cells on CHI-FN after 130 min of seeding. Interestingly, CHI-ES induces the formation of focal adhesion complexes in a lesser extent in cell but fails to lead to stress fiber formation. Overall, our study reveals that long-term adhesion contact evolution of esophageal epithelia is only triggered by both extracellular matrix protein and chitosan. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Surface characterization and platelet adhesion studies for the mixed
   self-assembled monolayers with amine and carboxylic acid terminated
   functionalities
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB The mixed self-assembled monolayers (SAM) prepared from long chain alkanethiols, HS(CH2)(11)NH2 and HS(CH2)(10)COOH, on gold are employed as the model surface for investigating the interactions between the biological environment and synthetic surface. A distinctive SAM preparation scheme was utilized in this investigation. The triethylamine was added to the alkanethiol solution during SAM formation and then followed by additional rinsing of SAM with 10% CH3COCH or 1% HCl ethanolic solution. The contact angle values of NH2 + COOH mixed SAMs were between those of the pure SAMs, except that it was prepared with solution mole fraction of amine-terminated alkanethiol at 0.2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis has indicated that these two distinctive SAM preparation procedures had both resulted in a reduction in oxidized sulfur species on pure -NH2 terminated SAM. However, the procedure utilizing 1% HCl ethanolic washing solution was more effective in reducing the unbound thiol fraction and to form a pure -NH2 SAM with better quality. XPS analysis has also revealed that the surface of NH2 + COOH mixed SAMs was "amine-rich". In vitro platelet adhesion assay has shown that the amount of adherent platelets on pure positive charged -NH2 terminated SAM is less than that on anionic -COOH terminated counterpart in both acidic ethanolic washing schemes. Moreover, the lowest platelet adhesion density was noted on the mixed SAM surfaces with surface amine mole fraction at 0.51 and 0.57. This finding suggests that the surface charge with near neutrality might be of importance in reducing platelet adhesion and activation on artificial biomaterial. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Evaluation of laser spallation as a technique for measurement of cell
   adhesion strength
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Cell adhesion to material surfaces is one of the fundamental phenomena of cellular response to implanted devices. Controlling the strength, dynamics, and mechanics of cell adhesion offer opportunities for designing novel biomaterials for tissue engineering and biotechnology. Many techniques have been developed for the purpose of quantifying various types of cell-biomaterial interaction. One method to evaluate cell affinity for a biomaterial is to measure the stress required to remove adherent cells from the material. This study investigates the possibility of using laser spallation, a technique previously developed for measuring the tensile strength of thin film interfaces, for evaluation of initial cell attachment strength. MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts were cultured on fibronectin-coated polystyrene, a surface known to engage cells in receptor mediated adhesion, and untreated polystyrene, which elicit nonspecific adhesion mechanisms during early stages of cell attachment. The laser spallation technique effectively detached cells from polymer substrates and also distinguished relative cell adhesion strengths to surfaces with known differences in cell binding affinities. Scanning electron micrographs determined that cell detachment resulting from laser spallation left a cleaner surface than jet impingement, possibly suggesting a more complete detachment mechanism. Absolute values of adhesion strengths determined by laser spallation were significantly higher than those found using jet impingement, a previously reported hydrodynamic technique.

TI Polymers with tunable toxicity: A reference scale for cytotoxicity
   testing of biomaterial surfaces
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB A series of copolymers, with varying ratio dimethylamino-ethylmethacrylate (DMAEMA) and methylmethacrylate (MMA), was designed as a potential scale for cytotoxicity. These copolymers were characterized for toxicity of their surface. The surfaces of washed copolymers display increasing toxicity with increasing DMAEMA content. The toxicity was observed for three different cell-types, namely mouse fibroblasts, human endothelial cells and human osteoblast-like cells. With an increasing toxic surface, cell growth was inhibited as was indicated by the proliferation marker Ki-67. Staining for F-actin revealed that with increasing DMAEMA, cells adopted a more and more round morphology, resulting in decreased surface-contact area. Immuno-staining for phospho-tyrosine or vinculin demonstrated gradual loss of focal adhesions on increasingly toxic surfaces. Surprisingly loss of focal adhesions coincided with an increase in paxillin and vinculin protein, indicating cells try compensating for loss of adhesion. This series of copolymers may have potential as a cytotoxicity scale. They provoke cellular responses ranging from highly toxic to completely non-toxic, with some showing intermediate toxicity.

TI Collagen biomaterial doped with colominic acid for cell culture
   applications with regard to peripheral nerve repair
SO JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Colominic acid (CA) is a homopolymer of sialic acid residues and is solely composed of polymerised units of alpha-2,8-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid. CA is a specific derivative of polysialic acid (PSA), produced as the capsular polysaccharide of Escherichia coli K1 derived molecule of PSA. PSA in vivo plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity and neural development. The use of collagen materials doped with defined CA is presented for the cultivation of various cell lines relevant for possible applications in Tissue Engineering. First, the release behaviour under culture conditions of the collagen-based (C-CA) materials was investigated by thiobarbituric acid assay. Additionally, the established cell lines, PC-12 and immortalised Schwann cells (ISC), used for neurobiological and neurochemical studies and the model liver cell line Hep-G2 as indicator for biocompatibility testing, were cultured on the C-CA matrix. Cell proliferation (MIT-test) and cell adhesion (DAPI-staining) of the cell lines on the matrices were observed. Likewise, gene expression of the marker genes thyrosine hydroxylase for the PC- 12 cells, and albumin, transferrin and CYP3A4 for the Hep-G2 cells was evaluated via RT-PCR. The results indicate that CA integration in established biomaterial constructs enhances cell proliferation and offers promising features as conduits additive in regarding peripheral nerve regeneration.

TI Effect of pH and metal ions on the decomposition rate of
   S-nitrosocysteine
SO ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs) have many biological functions including platelet deactivation, immunosupression, neurotransmission, and host defense. Most of the functions are attributed to nitric oxide (NO) release during S-nitrosothiol decomposition. As the simplest biologically occurring S-nitrosothiol, S-nitrosocysteine (CySNO) has been widely used as an NO donor and has also been incorporated into biomedical polymers. Knowledge of the CySNO decomposition rate is important for assessing the impact of CySNO on various bioengineering applications or biological systems. In this work, spectrophotometer measurements of CySNO decomposition in the presence of metal ions showed that the decomposition rate is highly susceptible to the pH. The maximum decomposition occurs near physiological pH (near 7.4) while in the acidic (pH < 6) and alkaline (pH > 9) condition CySNO is very stable. This demonstrates that blood provides an optimized environment for the decomposition of CySNO leading to the release of NO. The CySNO decomposition rate can also be affected by buffers with different purity levels in the presence and absence of metal ion chelators-although all buffers show the same pH phenomenon of maximizing near physiological pH. An equilibrium model of metal ions as a function of pH provides a plausible explanation for the pH dependence on the experimental decomposition rate.

TI A new class of bioactive and biodegradable soybean-based bone fillers
SO BIOMACROMOLECULES
AB The reconstruction of large bone defects in periodontal, maxillofacial, and orthopedic surgery relies on the implantation of biomaterials able to support the growth of new tissue. None of the materials currently available is able to combine all the properties required, which are (i) easy handling, (ii) biodegradation, (iii) low immunogenicity, and more importantly, (iv) induction of tissue regeneration. A new class of biodegradable biomaterials has been obtained by simple thermosetting of defatted soybean curd. The final material can be processed into films, porous scaffolds, and granules for different surgical needs. When incubated in physiological solutions the material shows water uptake of 80%, elongation at break of 0.9 mm/mm, and 25% (w/w) degradation in 7 days. Soybean-based biomaterial granules are shown to reduce the activity of the monocytes/macrophages and of the osteoclasts and to induce osteoblast differentiation in vitro, thus demonstrating a bone regeneration potential suitable for many clinical applications.

TI Molecular engineering as an approach to design new functional properties
   of alginate
SO BIOMACROMOLECULES
AB Through enzymatic modification, we are now able to manipulate the composition and sequential nanostructures of alginate, one of the most versatile gelling polymers found in nature. Here we report the application of a set of processive polymer-modifying epimerases for the preparation of novel alginates with highly improved functional properties essential for numerous applications as gel matrices. Gels of enzymatically engineered alginate were found to be more elastic and compact, less permeable, and extremely stable under physiological conditions, offering significant advantages over native alginates. As a result, this study shows that, by controlling alginate nanostructure, its macroscopic properties can be highly controlled. The ability to tailor alginate has a great impact on the wide use of this biomaterial in industry and medicine. More importantly, this adds more knowledge to the link between polymer nanostructure and macroscopic properties and may serve as a model system for other polymer-based materials.

AB Biologic scaffolds composed of naturally occurring extracellular matrix (ECM) have received significant attention for their potential therapeutic applications. The full potential of the ability of ECM scaffolds to promote constructive remodeling will not be realized, however, until an understanding of the biology and the external influences that affect biology, are better achieved. The factors that appear important for the constructive remodeling of ECM biologic scaffolds are its ability to be rapidly and completely degraded with the generation of downstream bioactive molecules, the bioinductive properties of the functional molecules that compose native ECM material and the ability to engineer its mechanical properties at the time of implantation through an understanding of its collagen fiber microstructure.

TI In vitro blood reactivity to hydroxylated and non-hydroxylated polymer
   surfaces
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Complement activation on hydroxyl-group-bearing surfaces is regarded as the main reason for granulocyte activation in applications of blood-contacting medical devices such as extracorporeal blood purification. However, the factors inducing the cell adhesion so far remained ambiguous. For a dedicated research, whole blood was incubated with a set of structurally similar polymer coatings on glass with either hydroxy or ether functionalities. By co-incubation of an activating with a non-activating surface, the reaction of granulocytes activated by complement fragments on non-activating surfaces could be evaluated. As expected, hydroxyl-terminated polymer layers induced much higher levels of complement activation than those with ether functionalities. Leukocyte activation, as measured by the expression of CD11b, correlated closely with the presence of free complement fragment C5a. However, adhesion of leukocytes was rather associated with the adsorption of activated fragments of C3 than with the activation level of the cells. Moreover, it was found that adsorbed quantities of fibrin and fibrinogen had little influence on leukocyte adhesion. It is concluded that the activation of leukocytes is triggered by soluble complement factors such as C5a while their adhesion on hydroxy-bearing surfaces is mainly triggered by the presence of surface-bound complement fragment Ob.

TI Role of plasma fibronectin in the foreign body response to biomaterials
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Host responses to biomaterials control the biological performance of implanted medical devices. Upon implantation, synthetic materials adsorb biomolecules, which trigger an inflammatory cascade comprising coagulation, leukocyte recruitment/adhesion, and foreign body reaction. The foreign body reaction and ensuing fibrous encapsulation severely limit the in vivo performance of numerous biomedical devices. While it is well established that plasma fibrinogen and secreted cytokines modulate leukocyte recruitment and maturation into foreign body giant cells, mediators of chronic inflammation and fibrous encapsulation of implanted biomaterials remain poorly understood. Using plasma fibronectin (pFN) conditional knock-out mice, we demonstrate that pFN modulates the foreign body response to polyethylene terephthalate disks implanted subcutaneously. Fibrous collagenous capsules were two-fold thicker in mice depleted of pFN compared to controls. In contrast, deletion of pFN did not alter acute leukocyte recruitment to the biomaterial, indicating that pFN modulates chronic fibrotic responses. The number of foreign body giant cells associated with the implant was three times higher in the absence of pFN while macrophage numbers were not different, suggesting that pFN regulates the formation of biomaterial-associated foreign body giant cells. Interestingly, cellular FN (cFN) was present in the capsules of both normal and pFN-depleted mice, suggesting that cFN could not compensate for the loss of pFN. These results implicate pFN in the host response to implanted materials and identify a potential target for therapeutic intervention to enhance the biological performance of biomedical devices.

TI Tissue-like self-assembly in cocultures of endothelial cells and
   osteoblasts and the formation of microcapillary-like structures on
   three-dimensional porous biomaterials
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The survival and functioning of a bone biomaterial requires a rapid and stable vascularization after implantation. However, the mechanisms involved in the context of the complex healing microenvironment are poorly understood. To evaluate the vascularization potential of bone biomaterials, angiogenic stimuli were added to human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) growing on three-dimensional (3-D) bone biomaterials consisting of porous hydroxyapatite, porous calcium phosphate, porous nickel-titanium, successfully being used in humans, and also silk fibroin nets. HDMEC did not migrate to form microcapillary-like structures as they did on cell culture plastic. In cocultures of HDMEC and primary human osteoblast cells (HOS) or the human osteoblast-like cell line MG-63 on these biomaterials, a tissue-like self-assembly of cells occurred with time, with endothelial cells forming microcapillary-like structures containing a lumen and giving a strong PECAM-1 expression at cell interfaces. These microcapillary-like structures were intertwined between cell layers of osteoblasts and did not form when exogenous angiogenic stimuli were added to these cocultures. The life span of HDMEC was also significantly enhanced by coculture; with HDMEC being present for up to at least 42 days, compared to the monoculture where cells began to die rapidly after I week without passage. This coculture system may be applicable to a prevascularization strategy for biomaterials prior to implantation. Irrespective of this, the coculture model holds promise for studies to deepen our understanding of bone regeneration on 3-D substrates. Most importantly, these data raise important questions concerning the exact nature of pro-angiogenic drug- or gene-delivery systems to be incorporated into scaffolds. Our results underline the necessity to take into account the in situ production of growth factors by invading mesenchymal cells in the regenerative niche. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Surface immobilization of bioactive molecules onto natural tissues has been interestingly studied for the development of new functional matrices for the replacement of lost or malfunctioning tissues. In this study, an acellular matrix of bovine pericardium (ABP) was chemically modified by the direct coupling of L-arginine after glutaraldehyde (GA) cross-linking. The effects of L-arginine coupling on durability and calcification were investigated and the biocompatibility was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. A four-step detergent and enzymatic extraction process has been utilized to remove cellular components from fresh bovine pericardium ( BP). Microscopic observation confirmed that nearly all cellular constituents are removed. Thermal and mechanical properties showed that the durability of L-arginine-treated matrices increased as compared with control ABP and GA-treated ABP. Resistance to collagenase digestion revealed that modified matrices have greater resistance to enzyme digestion than control ABP and GA-treated ABP. The in vivo calcification study demonstrated much less calcium deposition on L-arginine-treated ABP than GA-treated one. In vitro cell viability results showed that ABP modified with L-arginine leads to a significant increase in attachment of human dermal fibroblasts. The obtained results attest to the usefulness of L-arginine-treated ABP matrices for cardiovascular bioprostheses.

TI Profiling cell-biomaterial interactions via cell-based fluororeporter
   imaging
SO BIOTECHNIQUES
AB Cell-based. high-throughput screening has revolutionized the development of small-molecule pharmaceuticals. A similar paradigm for the accelerated development of biomaterials, for cell and tissue engineering involves the iterative use of combinatorial biomaterial synthesis, rapid cellular response screens, and computational modeling methods. However assays to probe cell responses to biomaterials are frequently subjective,e, lack dynamic responsiveness, and are limited to low-throughput experimentation. In this report, we highlight the use of high-resolution imaging of cell-based fluororeporters to establish and correlate quantifiable metrics of cell functional end points (e.g., cell growth, cell adhesion, cell attachment strength), as well as of intracellular cytoskeletal,features (e.g., descriptors of actin organization) on a set of model biomaterial substrates synthesized by combinatorial variations. Selected mammalian cell lines were genetically engineered with a series of green fluorescent protein (GFP).fusion genes to allow for live cell imaging on biomaterials. We demonstrate that high-content imaging yields a large number of quantifiable morphometric descriptors of ultrastructural cell features (e.g., cell cytoskeleton) in conjunction with densitometric descriptors of cell behaviors (e.g., cell apoptosis). Vile illustrate how such descriptors can be used to discern combinatorial variations in substrate composition, and how living GFP reporters are uniquely suited to generate such descriptors unlike fixed tissue preparations. This quantitative approach of live fluororeporter cell imaging could be valuable for metrology of tell-material interactions.

TI Antigen expression of cord blood derived stem cells under osteogenic
   stimulation in vitro
SO CELL BIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB Tissue engineering strategies have become a promising option for treating musculoskeletal defects in future. Cord blood includes mesenchymal stem cells which are able to differentiate into several cell lines under lineage specific stimulation including osteoblasts, chondroblasts and adipoblasts. In this study the antigen pattern of cord blood stem cells cultivated onto a porous porcine collagen I/III scaffold is investigated. The cultures were stimulated with osteogenic mixture (dexamethasone, ascorbic acid, glycerolphosphatate [DAG]) over 21 days in vitro. The following antigens and markers served for immuncytochemical evaluation: bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin, osteonectin, osteopontin, cartilage proteoglycan, chondrogenic oligomeric matrix protein, collagen I/II/III/X, CD13, CD 31, CD34, CD44, CD45, CD105, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, vascular endothelial growth factor, vimentin and von-Kossa and HE stainings. We showed that a collagen I/III scaffold is an appropriate cellular carrier for cord blood progenitor cells and allows for an osteoblastic differentiation. Moreover there were differences in antigen pattern, dependent on the location of the adherent cells. CD105 and VEGF were only expressed at the bottom of the biomaterial. Future investigations should show the role of cytomechanical forces in the differentiation of cord blood derived progenitor cells and also if a cell-loaded collagen I/III scaffold is appropriate to stimulate bone regeneration in vivo.

SO CURRENT APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The aim of this study is to compare de-aggregative ability of common organic dispersants for the acicular nano-apatite crystallite with main composition of calcium hydroxyapatite (HA) as a filler of composite containing polylactide (PLA) matrix. Firstly, the acicular nano-apatite powders with an average length of 70-120 nm were synthesized based on traditional chemical co-precipitation and freeze-drying techniques. Common organic dispersants including tetrahydrofuran, acetone, chloroform, N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) and ethanol were then employed to disperse synthetic freeze-dried ultra-fine nano-powders. The observations and weight of sediments showed that nano-apatite suspension dispersed by DMF and ethanol presented homogeneous and stable colloid after vigorly stirred for 24 h and then kept still for same time, respectively. Results of particle measurements and viscosity measurement illuminated that a large number of the nano-apatite particles with an average dimension of 297.86 nm and viscosity of 0.8872 cP in DMF suspension could be dispersed up to 91.28 nm by the DMF dispersant and the DMF dispersant could minimize agglomeration between the apatite ultrafine nano-powders. DMF is a more effective and appropriate dispersant to disperse the apatite nano-fillers than chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, acetone and ethanol, when the nano-apatite/PLA composite biomaterials were prepared.

TI Biomaterials for tissue reconstruction and bone substitution of the ear,
   nose and throat, face and neck
SO EXPERT REVIEW OF MEDICAL DEVICES
AB The role of biomaterials has become more important in the last 30 years in otorhinolaryngology. Legal directives for their use and, more importantly, indications have been specified. Biomaterials are medical devices, designed for tissue substitution or reconstruction. Approval labeling is issued in the form of European Community certification and postmarketing medical device safety in Europe - completely independent from the US FDA's certification. The indications for biomaterials are generally similar to those of autografts. Their main advantage is that they limit the morbidity caused by autograft harvesting. The benefits are aesthetic, functional or both. The main indications are in otology, sinus surgery, cranio-maxillo-facial traumatology, osteosynthesis and orthognatic surgery, skeletal augmentation and anti-aging surgery, facial prosthetic rehabilitation and laryngology. The research fields are extremely varied (e.g., increased therapeutic properties, drug-delivery systems or tissue engineering). Increasingly, biomaterials are implanted and the surgical success of their use is dependent upon strict legal labeling and well-defined indications.

TI Mechanobiology of mesenchymal stem cells and their use in cardiovascular
   repair
SO FRONTIERS IN BIOSCIENCE-LANDMARK
AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow have shown great promise in tissue repair. While these cells induce little immune response, they show marked self-renewal properties and can differentiate into many cell types. Recent evidence shows that mechanical factors such as fluid shear stress, mechanical strain and the rigidity of extracellular matrix can regulate the proliferation and differentiation of MSCs through various signaling pathways. Transplanted MSCs enhance angiogenesis and contribute to remodeling of the vasculature. In this review, we will focus on the responses of vascular cells and MSCs to shear stress, strain and matrix rigidity and will discuss the use of MSCs in myocardial repair and vascular tissue engineering.
