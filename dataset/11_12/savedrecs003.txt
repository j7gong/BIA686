AB Aim of the study is to investigate the in vitro reaction between rat bone cell and poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-matrix composites. Sample of Hydroxyapatite (HA) /PVA gel composites were prepared by the in situ growth method and Experiments of Alamar Blue Activity and Alkaline Phosphatase Assay were carefully made in our lab. SEM results displays that PVA-matrix composites containing HA fillers and pure PVA as a control group have an excellent biocompatible bone reaction in vitro with rat bone cells and HA filler particles in composites promote reaction between bone cell and composites. In vitro biology experiment resulted proves that adhesion, growth and differentiation of bone cells on all PVA-matrix composites are promoted by HA filler particles.

AB Rutile TiO2 films are normally used as biomaterial that synthesized on unheated stainless steel type 316L and glass slide substrates by dual cathode DC unbalanced magnetron sputtering. The influence of the substrate bias voltages (V-sb), from 0 V to -150V, on the structure of the as-deposited films was investigated. The crystal structure was characterized by grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) technique, the film's thickness and surface morphology was evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique, respectively. The results show that the as-deposited films were transparent and have high transmittance in visible regions. The crystal structure of as-deposited films show the XRD patterns of rutile (110) with V-sb, at 0V and shifted to rutile (101) with increasing V-sb. The films roughness (R-rms) and the thickness were 3.0 nm to 5.7 nm and 420 nm to 442 nm, respectively.

AB Chitosan possess many attractive properties for applying as biomaterials. For some application, biomaterial devices have to be sterilized using high temperature, e.g. stream sterilizing process. However, thermal degradation behavior of chitosan has been reported previously. Many researchers have attempted to improve thermal degradation behavior of chitosan by synthesize chitosan derivatives or blending chitosan with other polymers or additives. However, chitosan derivatives found to be less thermal stability than chitosan itself. On the contrary, adding some lipid additive could improve thermal stability of chitosan. In this study, protecting effect of aluminum monostearate (Alst) on thermal stability of chitosan was investigated employing thermal analysis techniques, e.g. thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and hot-stage microscope. Lactic acid solution (2% w/v) was used as solvent for dissolving chitosan. Chitosan solution, named as chtiosan-lactate (CL) and chitosan solution contained 2.5% w/w Alst (CLAlst) were prepared and fabricated into sponges using freeze drying technique. Degradation temperature of CLAlst system investigated from TO was shifted to the higher temperature comparing that of CL which indicated that Alst could improve thermal stability of chitosan after processed as biomaterial. From DSC result, small endothermic peak was observed around 60-70 degrees C for CLAlst whereas that of CL did not exhibit any peak. Melting behavior of the sponges observed under hot-stage microscope was demonstrated that chitosan was decomposed whereas Alst dispersed in chitosan backbone was gradually melted.

AB Porous tantalum, a new low modulus metal with a characteristic appearance similar to cancellous/trabecular bone, is currently available for use in several orthopedic applications (hip and knee arthroplasty, spine surgery, and bone graft substitute). The open-cell structure of repeating dodecahedrons is produced via carbon vapor deposition/infiltration of commercially pure tantalum onto a vitreous carbon scaffolding. This transition metal maintains several interesting biomaterial properties, including: a high volumetric porosity (70-80%), low modulus of elasticity (3MPa), and high frictional characteristics. Tantalum has excellent biocompatibility and is safe to use in vivo as evidenced by its historical and current use in pacemaker electrodes, cranioplasty plates and as radiopaque markers. The bioactivity and biocompatibility of porous tantalum stems from its ability to form a self-passivating surface oxide layer. This surface layer leads to the formation of a bone-like apatite coating in vivo and affords excellent bone and fibrous in-growth properties allowing for rapid and substantial bone and soft tissue attachment. Tantalum-chondrocyte composites have yielded successful early results in vitro and may afford an option for joint resurfacing in the future. The development of porous tantalum is in its early stages of evolution and the following represents a review of its biomaterial properties and fabrication methods for applications as implant biomaterials.

The experiment results indicate that the the composition of terpolymers have an obvious influence on the structure of PGGS terpolymers. The degradation rate increases with the increasing crosslink degree of PGGS.

TI Education, animals, and the commodity form
SO CULTURE AND ORGANIZATION
AB What would biocommodities say if they could teach? This article investigates what kind of work education performs in biocommoditization processes. It makes two contributions to scholarship on commoditization. First, it integrates education into Marx's formula for the circulation of capital through the commodity form. Second, it provides a case study of veterinary education to develop Helmreich's unfinished worksheet of biocommoditization, that is, the adaptation of Marx's formula to biocapital accumulation (BCB'). With the material embeddedness of veterinary education in the animal commodity form as an empirical example viewed through a synthesis of Marxist and posthumanist analyses, this article works through each component of Helmreich's BCB' chain (animal material, animal commodity, animal capital), with particular attention to its interplay with educational practice. In the end, education emerges as a vitalizing guide among other organic and inorganic actants that channel student traffic into the animal economy. This channeling of student traffic is, however, complicated by an element of indeterminacy always already accompanying the education process as well as the transformation of biomaterial into capital.

AB Engineering on a nano-scale has been undertaken to mimic a biomaterial by forming an intercalated nano-composite structure by PVD sputtering of a polymer with a nickel-titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloy (SMA). A PTFE polymer has been selected due to its elastic properties, low interactions with water, optimum surface energies, stability and chemical resistance. NiTi SMAs allow the coatings to be energy absorbent and thus suitable in load bearing situations. The coatings are aimed to constantly withstand variable adverse biological environments whilst maintaining their characteristics. The nano-intercalated structures have been characterised for their wettability, friction coefficients, chemical composition, and morphology. Intercalation of a polymer with energy-absorbing alloys uncovers a set of material systems that will offer characteristics such as self-healing of hierarchal tissue in the body. The reformation of PTFE following sputter deposition was confirmed by FTIR spectra. According to SEM analysis PTFE shows a promising surface interaction with NiTi, forming stable coatings. Surface interactions are evident by the hydrophobic behaviour of films as the composite's water contact angle is around 86 degrees, which lies in-between that of PTFE and NiTi. The nano composite films are lubricious and have a measured CoF below 0.2 which does not vary with layer thickness.

TI Novel nanostructured biomaterials: implications for coronary stent
   thrombosis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE
AB Background: Nanomedicine has the potential to revolutionize medicine and help clinicians to treat cardiovascular disease through the improvement of stents. Advanced nanomaterials and tools for monitoring cell-material interactions will aid in inhibiting stent thrombosis. Although titanium boron nitride (TiBN), titanium diboride, and carbon nanotube (CNT) thin films are emerging materials in the biomaterial field, the effect of their surface properties on platelet adhesion is relatively unexplored.
   Objective and methods: In this study, novel nanomaterials made of amorphous carbon, CNTs, titanium diboride, and TiBN were grown by vacuum deposition techniques to assess their role as potential stent coatings. Platelet response towards the nanostructured surfaces of the samples was analyzed in line with their physicochemical properties. As the stent skeleton is formed mainly of stainless steel, this material was used as reference material. Platelet adhesion studies were carried out by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy observations. A cell viability study was performed to assess the cytocompatibility of all thin film groups for 24 hours with a standard immortalized cell line.
   Results: The nanotopographic features of material surface, stoichiometry, and wetting properties were found to be significant factors in dictating platelet behavior and cell viability. The TiBN films with higher nitrogen contents were less thrombogenic compared with the biased carbon films and control. The carbon hybridization in carbon films and hydrophilicity, which were strongly dependent on the deposition process and its parameters, affected the thrombogenicity potential. The hydrophobic CNT materials with high nanoroughness exhibited less hemocompatibility in comparison with the other classes of materials. All the thin film groups exhibited good cytocompatibility, with the surface roughness and surface free energy influencing the viability of cells.

Water swelling experiments indicate that all samples have a great capacity for water uptake, while a remarkable overshoot occurs for the membranes electrospun from PHBV-g-PVP other than those from PHBV. DSC characterization indicates that only non-freezable bound water and free water can be distinguished in all electrospun membranes.

AB The silk fibroin/sodium alginate scaffolds were prepared using lyophilization method. And then, the blend scaffolds were treated with calcium ions. The morphology of the blend scaffolds exhibited a thin layer structure before calcium ions treatment, and much more rod-like structure appeared at the layer surface with adding the increase content of sodium alginate in the blend scaffolds. After calcium ions treatment, much more rod-like structure disappeared after adding 30% sodium alginate or more in the blend scaffolds. Wide angle X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared analysis results confirmed the crystal structure of silk fibroin was not influenced by adding the different content of sodium alginate, exhibiting the silk I and silk II structure co-existed in the blend scaffolds. And the same time, the average mass loss value of the blend scaffolds was higher than the pure silk fibroin scaffold, reaching 9.884%, 11.2%, and 8.626%, respectively, when the blend scaffolds contained 10%, 30%, and 50% sodium alginate, respectively. Thus, the silk fibroin/sodium alginate scaffolds should be a useful biomaterial applicable for a wide range of tissue engineering.

AB With the development of functional and structural materials, increasing interests have been shown in the field of biomaterials with a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic), which exhibit the unusual property of becoming thinner when compressed. This unusual property makes it potentially a synthetic replacement biomaterial with adequate mechanical property and wear resistance. In this study, the potential of applying the auxetic ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) for the artificial hip joint was discussed. The contact mechanics characteristics in artificial hip joint replacement under different Poisson's ratios of -1<mu <= 0.5 were investigated and compared using the finite element method. The results show that Poisson's ratio had great effect on the contact mechanics in artificial hip joint replacement. Therefore, the future work should focus on tailoring an auxetic UHMWPE with a suitable Poisson's ratio for artificial hip joint replacements.

AB Wear on Co-Cr-Mo biomedical implants is still a major issue especially for applications in articulation joints like in total ankle, knee and hip arthroplasty. Generation of excessive wear particles can coagulate in body tissues which later cause inflammation, bone loss and necrosis. Modification of implant surfaces is a common technique for increasing the hardness and thus minimizing these effects. hi this study, thermal oxidation method was carried out on the Co-Cr-Mo to investigate the effects of different pretreatment processes and surface roughness on the hardness of oxide layer formed. Prior to oxidation process, all samples were annealed and pickled to remove residual stress and oxide scales respectively. The oxidation process was done inside furnace under atmospheric condition for 3 hours at 1160 degrees C. The metallic compositions, surface morphology and hardness of the oxide layer formed on the substrate were verified using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope and micro-Vickers hardness analysis respectively. It is found that mechanical pretreatment provides oxide/carbide layer with higher hardness than chemical pretreatment method. It is believed that remnants of polishing diamond pastes trapped in roughness valleys react with metal matrix and later transform into carbides during oxidation process. In contrast, initial surface roughness of the substrate has no significant effect on the hardness of oxide/carbide layer.

AB Ti-6A1-4V ELI (Extra Low Interstitial) alloy have been widely used as alternative bone due to its excellent biocompatibility, although it still has many problems such as high elastic modulus and toxic. Therefore, biomaterial with low elastic modulus and nontoxic has to be developed. In this study, the raw materials which are nontoxic elements such as Nb and Mo were mixed and milled in a mixing machine (24h) and a high energy mechanical ball milling machine (1h, 4h and 8h) respectively. Ti-Nb-Mo-CPP composites were fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS) at 1000 degrees C under 70MPa using mixed and milled powders. The effects of CPP contents and milling time on biocompatibility and mechanical property have been investigated. By X-ray diffraction (XRD), chemical reaction during the sintering was occurred and revealed new phases, Ti2O, CaO, CaTiO3, and TixPy. Vickers hardness of composites increases with increase milling time and addition of HA contents. Biocompatibility of HA added Ti-Nb-Si alloys were improved.

AB Collagen hydrogels are widely used as three-dimensional scaffolds for cells and tissue in culture environments. These materials, which consist of crosslinked biopolymer (protein-based) networks in aqueous media, are particularly suitable for recreating part of the extra-cellular matrix, but their poor mechanical properties represent a major limitation. One strategy to enhance the strength of this kind of hydrogels might be to incorporate clay nanoscopic particles. In fact, it has been observed that the charged surface of clay nanosheets can interact with certain functional groups belonging to polymer molecules, yielding stronger networks. Moreover, clay particles are recognized to be biocompatible. In the present work, the gelation process and the resulting morphological and mechanical properties of collagen/laponite clay nanocomposite hydrogels were invastigated. Upon gelation, the biopolymer molecules assemble into nanoscale fibrils, which bundle into fibers and entangle into a three-dimensional network. The network characteristics depend on tunable parameters such as pH and clay concentration.

Hydroxyapatite(HA) has good biocompatibility and biological activity and has become one of the replacement materials of biomedical stiff hemopoietic tissue, but the application of HA biomaterial is hindered because HA is brittle and has low strength. Integrating good mechanical properties of metallic materials with excellent biological performance of HA, the composite obtained by coating HA to the surface of metallic matrix is ideal rehabilitation material of bone tissue. In the present study, a new Mg-4.0Zn-1.0Ca-0.6Zr(wt%) was designed according to the requirements of biocompatibility. The microstructures and the mechanical properties of the new alloy were investigated by experiment. The excellent mechanical properties fully meet the service requirements of human bone tissue for mechanical property. Flat and dense hydroxyapatite coating was prepared on the surface of magnesium alloy matrix by preceding alkali heat treatment, electrodeposition and post alkali heat treatment. The Structure and constituent of HA coating and the biodegradation behavior of HA-coated Mg-4.0Zn-1.0Ca-0.6Zr (wt%) alloy were evaluated. Resuls showed that the degradation rate of HA-coated Mg-4.0Zn-1.0Ca-0.6Zr(wt%) alloy in SBF biomimetic solution decreased obviously and tended to be stable after 10 days. As degradable implantation materials, HA-coated Mg-4.0Zn-1.0Ca-0.6Zr(wt%) alloy fully meets the service requirements of human bone tissue.

AB Formation of hydroxyapatite (HAp) in simulated body fluid (SBF) on heated nacre has been examined. Nacre is known as composite layer of aragonite platelets and organic materials. Nacre was obtained from the shell of Akoya pearl oyster after removing its prismatic layer. The nacre was heated up to 300 degrees C in air and then soaked in SBF. Nacre heated at 300 degrees C lost iridescent color and became brittle, implying that organic materials which plays a role as glue between aragonite platelets mostly disappeared by heating at 300 degrees C. Formation of HAp particles on nacre in SBF was easier than that on pure Ti. Maximum formation rate of HAp particles was obtained on the nacre heated at 200 degrees C. The amount of HAp particles formed on the nacre heated at 300 degrees C is the smallest. The organic materials in nacre play a critical role for HAp formation on nacre in SBF.

AB A novel biomedical titanium alloy with the ability to undergo self adjustment in its Young's modulus was developed. In spinal fixation devices, the Young's modulus of the metallic implant rod should be sufficiently high to suppress springback for the surgeon, but should also be sufficiently low to prevent stress shielding for the patient. Therefore, deformation-induced omega phase transformation was introduced into beta-type titanium alloys so that the Young's modulus of only the deformed part would increase during operation, while that of the non-deformed part would remain low. The increase in the Young's modulus due to cold rolling was investigated for a binary Ti-12Cr alloy (mass%). Microstructural observation and Young's modulus measurement reveal that the Ti-12Cr alloy undergoes deformation-induced omega phase transformation and exhibits the increase in the Young's modulus by deformation.

AB Electrospinning technique is an efficient processing method to manufacture micro- and nano-sized fibrous structures by electrostatic force for different applications. In biomaterial field, electrospinning technique has been successfully utilized to prepare new drug delivery materials and tissue engineering scaffolds. Fiber mats of biodegradable polymers having a diameter in the nano- to submicro-scale can be considered to mimic the nanofibrous structure of native extracellular matrix (ECM).
   Native extracellular matrix, constituted of proteins and polysaccharides improving cells growth in its nanofibrous porous structure, controls not only the cell phenotype, but the whole structure of the biological tissues.
   In the present study we investigated the effect of electrospun reconstituted collagen fibers onto metals for oral implants devices manufacturing as far as the osteoblastic differentiation potential of stem cells and cytofunctionality of osteoblasts in-vitro. The cells cultured onto titanium samples coated with ECM constituents showed faster osteoblastic differentiation and more efficient deposition of mineralized matrix in comparison with those onto uncoated substrates.

TI Minimally invasive cell-seeded biomaterial systems for
   injectable/epicardial implantation in ischemic heart disease
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE
AB Myocardial infarction (MI) is characterized by heart-wall thinning, myocyte slippage, and ventricular dilation. The injury to the heart-wall muscle after MI is permanent, as after an abundant cell loss the myocardial tissue lacks the intrinsic capability to regenerate. New therapeutics are required for functional improvement and regeneration of the infarcted myocardium, to overcome harmful diagnosis of patients with heart failure, and to overcome the shortage of heart donors. In the past few years, myocardial tissue engineering has emerged as a new and ambitious approach for treating MI. Several left ventricular assist devices and epicardial patches have been developed for MI. These devices and acellular/cellular cardiac patches are employed surgically and sutured to the epicardial surface of the heart, limiting the region of therapeutic benefit. An injectable system offers the potential benefit of minimally invasive release into the myocardium either to restore the injured extracellular matrix or to act as a scaffold for cell delivery. Furthermore, intramyocardial injection of biomaterials and cells has opened new opportunities to explore and also to augment the potentials of this technique to ease morbidity and mortality rates owing to heart failure. This review summarizes the growing body of literature in the field of myocardial tissue engineering, where biomaterial injection, with or without simultaneous cellular delivery, has been pursued to enhance functional and structural outcomes following MI. Additionally, this review also provides a complete outlook on the tissue-engineering therapies presently being used for myocardial regeneration, as well as some perceptivity into the possible issues that may hinder its progress in the future.

SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Heavy metal ions and dissolved organic compounds in waste water are known to adversely affect human health, aquatic life and the overall ecosystem. Many hazardous pollutants need to be removed from drinking water; however, such technologies are not accessible for economically disadvantaged people around the world. Naturally abundant tomato peels or other biomembranes are used as an efficient biomaterial to remove toxic metal ions and organic pollutants from aqueous solution. The functional groups and morphologies of the tomato peels were characterized using FT-IR and FESEM, respectively. Factors such as pH, nature and amount of adsorbent used for extraction were studied to establish the optimum conditions. The maximum adsorption capacity was observed at different pH values for different pollutants. The equilibrium adsorption data were interpreted by using Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms and the adsorption mechanism was investigated by kinetic studies. Results showed that tomato peels have good potential as an efficient adsorbent to remove various pollutants from water.

AB Uncontrolled interactions between synthetic materials and human tissues are a major concern for implants and tissue engineering. It is well recognized that osteoblasts (bone cells) preferentially adhere to specific amino acid sequences such as arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) and heparin-sulphate ligand binding regions in adsorbed proteins. Accordingly, how specific amino acid sequences are exposed in adsorbed proteins to associate with binding to integrin receptors in cell membranes is critical to whether cell adhesion will occur on an implant surface. The abundance of positive binding sites to electron deficient sites of the protein molecules presents a strong case for adhesion of these cell adhesion ligands on to a biomaterial surface. This paper reviews the study based on a molecular orbital interactive method for prediction of the biocompatibility of implants based on a protein-biomaterial surface interaction.

AB Background/Aims. Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced injury is an acute injury mainly caused by surgical procedures. And HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) is known to protect against I/R-injury effectively. The sufficient dose of HGF must be topically delivered to the target organ to minimize the organ damage on surgery (reperfusion) and the dose of drug. For this purpose, we developed a novel technology for converting a fragile disk of the conventional type-I collagen gel into a strong and transparent 'vitrigel membrane', based on a concept for the vitrification of heat-denatured proteins.
   In the present study, we examined the efficacy of the newly designed 'HGF-containing collagen vitrigel sheet' as an effective drug delivery system in mouse liver I/R model.
   Materials and methods. Male C57Black6 mice were subjected to 60 min-liver ischemia (middle and left liver lobes) and reperfusion. Immediately after liver ischemia, the ischemic liver lobes were covered by collagen vitrigel sheet containing (3 mu g/ml). Reperfused liver injury was evaluated by biochemical/histological methods and bio-imaging of hepatic oxidative stress (redox-sensitive GFP probe) and apoptosis (bioluminescent caspase-3 activity probe).
   Results. Collagen vitrigel sheet (containing hHGF) released hHGF until 96 hr in vitro and successfully delivered hHGF to the liver tissue suffering I/R. This effectively protected liver from I/R-induced injury. Blood biochemistry showed reduced levels of serum GOT/GPT/LDH, and liver histology revealed reduced necrotic area in the hHGF-treated liver. Oxidative stress and caspase-3 activity of the liver were examined by bio-imaging, which revealed that hHGF delivered by vitrigel sheet significantly reduced oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death in the post-ischemic liver.
   Conclusions. hHGF-containing collagen vitrigel sheet protected liver from I/R-induced injury. Collagen vitrigel sheet may have good therapeutic potential in topical drug delivery in various clinical settings.

AB The performance of biomaterial scaffolds for bone tissue engineering, as porous titanium implants, is strongly dependent of its structural features. A reliable structural characterization of this kind of implant is very important. The most of image analysis techniques just supplies 2D information about the structure of specimens. X-ray microtomography is imaging technique that can produce 3D images of samples, however, stochastic models can also estimate properties of porous materials in 3D. This work presents the evaluation of a 3D model (using a truncated Gaussian method) in comparison to 3D microtomography volume, both from a titanium scaffold sample. In order to compare, geometrical parameters were measured for both 3D volumes. By the results, the truncated Gaussian 3D method reproduced a model with similar values to the microtomography volume, showing a good agreement among data, which suggests the use of this technique to estimate physical parameters of titanium scaffolds

AB In this work, the effect of sintering atmosphere on the corrosion resistance of sintered titanium has been evaluated in 0.9 % aqueous NaCl solution to simulate physiological environment. Corrosion tests were performed on titanium porous sintered under vacuum and vacuum plus dynamic argon. The results showed better passive properties associated to the titanium sintered under argon plus vacuum atmosphere than to the vacuum sintered titanium. The better corrosion resistance of the argon plus vacuum sintered titanium was attributed to the formation of a thin passive film on the titanium surface during sintering due the low oxygen content present in this atmosphere.

AB The rise of human life expectancy results in the increasing of elderly population and consequently the diseases of old age, which are mostly related with bone degenerative diseases. These problems also affect young individuals, commonly due to accidents (automobile and work). This fact has stimulated the research and development of materials that can replace or regenerate the damaged bone. From the engineering view, bone is a composite material consisting of an organic matrix (collagen), reinforced by an inorganic component (hydroxyapatite). The search for a suitable material, with properties tailored to the needs of the bone metabolism, as well as the adequate way of material processing, which ensures the maintenance or improvement of their initial properties, motivated this research. In this work was developed composite materials, based on bioresorbable polymer (PLLA) and phosphocalcic nanoceramic (HA). The composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (microstructure) and dynamical mechanical analyses (mechanical behavior). The results indicated these materials as promising for applications in the medical and dental manufacturing devices (plates and screws) by injection molding, and also for scaffolds by rapid manufacturing, in the tissue engineering area.

In contrast, the bioglass is a resorbable and osteoinductive material, the present work objective the development of composites of dispersed bovine bone or sintetic HA in silicate-phosphate bioglass, seeking to obtain a biomaterial with properties suitable for application as bone grafts. The composites were prepared by mixing between the powder components followed by sintering for 1h. Were used HA and bioglass (45S5) with particle size <240 mu m. The tested proportions of HA/45S5 were 20/80, 30/70 and 40/60 (wt%).

Glasses were developed at the stoichiometric composition of 66%.molSiO(2):33%.molLiO(2) using commercial SiO2 and the one obtained by thermochemical treatment of rice husk. The influence of rice husk-SiO2 on crystallization process to different granulometry, microstructure and kinetic behavior was determined and discussed. Investigations were carried out by means of differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Amorphous and transparent glasses were obtained after melting. The lithium disilicate glass-ceramic crystallization peaks (Tp) are between 550 to 660 degrees C to different granulometry (<63 mu m, 63 mu m < x < 250 mu m and 1mm < x < 2mm) and DTA heat rates (5; 10; 15; and 20 degrees C/min) in both glasses from different silica sources, and the formed phase was Li2Si2O5 as the crystalline phase after DTA thermal analysis as XRD confirmation. Improve in mechanical properties were estimated by morphological analysis of the microstructure modification in increasing the heat treatments temperature by SEM. The increase of glass substitution for crystalline phase was also observed with SEM images to both glass-ceramics from different silica sources.

AB Titanium and Ti alloys have been widely used as biomaterial due to their mechanical properties and high in vitro and in vivo cytocompatibility. Studies have showed that the acceleration of the osseointegration process is associated to the modification of the surface morphology. The aim of this work is to study the influence of the operating parameters of titanium electropolishing to obtain nanostructured titanium surfaces. The titanium electropolishing was carried out with different temperatures (7 degrees C, 18 degrees C and 25 degrees C), current density of 0.19 A/cm(2) and electropolishing time of 8 minutes. After the electropolishing process the titanium samples were characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy, profilometry (mechanical profilometer) and contact angle measurements. Preliminary results showed that the Ti nanostructured surfaces formation, strongly depends on the control of operating parameters.

TI Viability and function of primary human endothelial cells on smooth
   poly(ether imide) films
SO CLINICAL HEMORHEOLOGY AND MICROCIRCULATION
AB Poly(ether imide) (PEI) is being explored as potential biomaterial for cardiovascular applications. Different studies showed that human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC) are able to adhere and proliferate on PEI membranes (R-q = 13.20 +/- 1.58 nm). Arecently published study revealed evidence for much lower platelet adhesion on very smooth PEI-films (R-q = 2.37 +/- 1.40 nm).
   Therefore, we explored whether primary human venous endothelial cells (HUVEC) are able to adhere and proliferate on such very smooth PEI-films compared to tissue-cultured polystyrene (TCP) as reference material.
   Cytotoxicity testing revealed that PEI had a slight cytotoxic effect on HUVEC accompanied by a marginal reduced integrity of the plasma membrane and a significant lower mitochondrial activity. However long-term seeding experiments up to eleven days exhibited that HUVEC were able to proliferate on the PEI-films till confluence (TCP 96,190 +/- 18,289 cells/cm(2); PEI 91,590 +/- 19,583 cells/cm(2)). Further studies are planned to monitor the influence of shear force on the endothelial cell monolayer in a dynamic test system to determine its stability in view of shear resistant endothelialization of PEI for cardiovascular devices.

TI The influence of poly(n-butyl acrylate) networks on viability and
   function of smooth muscle cells and vascular fibroblasts
SO CLINICAL HEMORHEOLOGY AND MICROCIRCULATION
AB Background: The patency of small-diameter vascular prostheses is limited by several factors such as thrombogenicity, which is strongly influenced by surface roughness and chemical composition, or a mechanical mismatch between the elastic modulus of an artery and of the vascular prosthesis. A confluent layer of endothelial cells onto the inner surface of vascular prostheses could improve the hemocompatibility of the device. Biomaterials with adjustable elastic properties could be tailored to the values of human arteries so that a prothesis mismatch could be avoided.
   It was recently demonstrated that a co-culture of endothelial cells with angiogenically stimulated monocytes (aMO2) shows an accelerated formation of a functional confluent endothelial cell monolayer on soft hydrophobic poly(n-butyl acrylate) (cPnBA) networks. In addition, the cell compatibility with vascular smooth muscle cells and aortic fibroblasts, which are other important cell types of the vessel wall, is essential for a vascular prosthesis material and must therefore be explored.
   Purpose: Here we investigated the interaction of human vascular smooth muscle cells and aortic fibroblasts with cPnBA04 and cPnBA73.
   Material and methods: Human primary vascular smooth muscle cells and aortic fibroblasts were seeded on the two cPnBAs with different elastic moduli (cPnBA04 - 250 kPa and cPnBA73 - 1100 kPa) over 72 h. A live-dead staining (fluorescein diacetate/propium iodide) was performed to determine the morphology and viability of adherent cells. Furthermore, the extracellular matrix components, the actin cytoskeleton, the cell-material-contacts and the cytokine profiles were analysed.
   Results: Both cell types adhered and were viable on cPnBA04 and cPnBA73. The level of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) by smooth muscle cells and vascular fibroblasts was comparable to that of cells cultivated on a control material. The release of these cytokines by human fibroblasts was higher on cPnBA73 compared to cPnBA04. Both cell types secreted an extracellular matrix comparable to cells seeded on a control material.
   Conclusion: The study revealed, that cPnBA with varying elastic moduli are not only suitable for the cultivation of endothelial cells, but also for human vascular smooth muscle cells and aortic fibroblasts. Therefore, cPnBA could be a potential candidate material for the development of cardiovascular prostheses.

TI Smooth muscle and endothelial cell behaviour on degradable
   copolyetheresterurethane films
SO CLINICAL HEMORHEOLOGY AND MICROCIRCULATION
AB Stent thrombosis and restenosis after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation remains a relevant problem in the cardiovascular field. The polymer-based biomaterial (e. g. stent coating) requirements are comprehensive, since the polymeric material ideally should ensure an effective re-endothelialization by recruiting endothelial cells (EC) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC). Simultaneously, the polymer should effectively prevent adherence of smooth muscle cells (SMC) and thereby inhibiting restenosis.
   The aim of this study was to gain a basic understanding on the interaction of SMC and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with nonporous polymer films. A multifunctional copolyetheresterurethane (PDC) was chosen as candidate material: PDC consists of poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO) and poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-segments (PCL). In our study it was compared to the degradable PPDO homopolymer and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) (PVDF), an established coating material of DES in clinical applications intended for longterm applications. The films were analyzed according to their thermomechanical and surface properties before being examined in contact with HUVEC and SMC concerning cell viability, proliferation and adhesion.
   Experimental results showed that adhesion could be improved for HUVEC on PDC compared to PPDO and PVDF. In contrast, SMC attachment is largely suppressed on PDC polymeric films indicating a cell-specific response of HUVEC towards PDC. In conclusion, PDC represents a promising candidate material for future cardiovascular applications like e. g. biodegradable (PDC) stent coatings.

TI Influence of fiber orientation in electrospun polymer scaffolds on
   viability, adhesion and differentiation of articular chondrocytes
SO CLINICAL HEMORHEOLOGY AND MICROCIRCULATION
AB Degradable polymers with a tailorable degradation rate might be promising candidate materials for biomaterial-based cartilage repair. In view of the poor intrinsic healing capability of cartilage, implantation of autologous chondrocytes seeded on a biocompatible slow degrading polymer might be an encouraging approach to improve cartilage repair in the future. This study was undertaken to test if the fiber orientation (random versus aligned) of two different degradable polymers and a polymer intended for long term applications could influence primary articular chondrocytes growth and ultrastructure.
   A degradable copoly(ether) esterurethane (PDC) was synthesized via co-condensation of poly(p-dioxanone) diol and poly(epsilon-caprolactone) diol using an aliphatic diisocyanate as linker. Poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO) was applied as commercially available degradable polymer, while polyetherimide (PEI) was chosen as biomaterial enabling surface functionalization. The fibrous scaffolds of PDC and PPDO were obtained by electrospinning using 1,1,1,3,3,3 hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFP), while for PEI dimethyl acetamide (DMAc) was applied as solvent. Primary porcine articular chondrocytes were seeded at different cell densities on the fibrous polymer scaffolds and analyzed for viability (fluorescein diacetate/ethidiumbromide staining), for type II collagen synthesis (immunolabelling), ultrastructure and orientation on the fibers (SEM: scanning electron microscopy).
   Vital chondrocytes adhered on all electrospun scaffolds irrespective of random and aligned topologies. In addition, the chondrocytes produced the cartilage-specific type II collagen on all tested polymer topologies suggesting their differentiated functions. SEM revealed an almost flattened chondrocytes shape on scaffolds with random fiber orientation: whereby chondrocytes growth remained mainly restricted to the scaffold surface. On aligned fibers the chondrocytes exhibited a more spindle-shaped morphology with rougher cell surfaces but only a minority of the cells aligned according to the fibers. As a next step the reduction of the fiber diameter of electrospun scaffolds should be addressed as an important parameter to mimic cartilage ECM structure.

TI Elastic multiblock copolymers for vascular regeneration: Protein
   adsorption and hemocompatibility
SO CLINICAL HEMORHEOLOGY AND MICROCIRCULATION
AB Hemocompatibility of elastic multiblock copolymers PDC, based on poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO)/poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-segments, capable of a shape-memory effect, and PDD, based on PPDO/poly((adipinate-alt-1,4-butanediol)-co(adipinate-alt-ethylene glycol)-co-adipinate-alt-diethylene glycol)-segments, was studied in order to assess their suitability for an application aiming at blood vessels regeneration. The results were compared with polypropylene (PP) which is a widely used blood-contacting material for devices as blood oxygenators and dialysis tubes. Protein adsorption studies showed diverse blood plasma proteins in a relatively high amount on both elastic polymers compared to the poor amount of plasma proteins adsorbed on PP. Study of the coagulation system revealed high thrombin formation on PDC and no difference in plasma kallikrein activation between elastic multiblock copolymers and the reference PP. Activation of complement system was higher for PDC followed by PDD and lower for PP. However, platelet adhesion and activation were hardly suppressed on the multiblock copolymers compared to the PP surface, where the number of adhered platelets and the activation rate were significant. The present results reveal that the tested multiblock copolymers with improved elastic properties and shape-memory capability (PDC) show low thrombogenicity and are promising candidates for vascular tissue engineering.

TI Automated image-based analysis of adherent thrombocytes on polymer
   surfaces
SO CLINICAL HEMORHEOLOGY AND MICROCIRCULATION
AB A dataset of 439 confocal laser scanning microscopic images was analyzed to investigate the potential of an image-based automated analysis for identifying and assessing adherent thrombocytes on polymer surfaces. Parameters for image optimization of glutardialdehyde induced fluorescence images were classified and data mining was performed using the Java image processing software ImageJ. Previously reported analysis required that each thrombocyte had to be identified interactively and outlined manually. Now, we were able to determine the number and area of adherent thrombocytes with high accuracy (spearman correlation coefficient r=0.98 and r=0.99) using a two-stage filter-set, including a rolling ball background subtraction-and a watershed segmentation-algorithm. Furthermore, we could proof a significant correlation between these parameters (spearman correlation coefficient r=0.97), determining both as suitable predictors for the evaluation of material induced thrombogenicity. The here reported image-based automated analysis can be successfully applied to identify and measure adherent thrombocytes on polymer surfaces and, thus, might be successfully integrated in a high-throughput screening process to evaluate biomaterial hemocompatibility.

TI The influence of polymer scaffolds on cellular behaviour of bone marrow
   derived human mesenchymal stem cells
SO CLINICAL HEMORHEOLOGY AND MICROCIRCULATION
AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types. Therefore, they are widely explored in regenerative medicine. The interaction of MSCs with biomaterials is of great importance for cell proliferation, differentiation and function, and can be strongly influenced by numerous factors, such as the chemical nature and the mechanical properties of the material surface.
   In this study, we investigated the interaction of bone marrow derived human MSCs with different amorphous and transparent polymers namely polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC), poly(ether imide) (PEI), polyetherurethane (PEU) and poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (PSAN). To ensure that the MSCs were solely in contact to the testing material we applied polymeric inserts, which were prepared from the aforementioned polymers via injection molding. The explored inserts exhibited a similar wettability with advancing contact angles ranging from 84 +/- 7 degrees (PEU) to 99 +/- 5 degrees (PS) and a surface roughness of R-q <= 0.86 mu m. The micromechanical properties determined by AFM indentation varied from 6 +/- 1 GPa (PEU) to 24 +/- 5 GPa (PSAN).
   Cells presented different adhesion rates on the polymer surfaces 24 hours after seeding (45 +/- 7% (PS), 63 +/- 1% (PC), 75 +/- 4% (PEI), 69 +/- 2% (PEU) and 61 +/- 5% (PSAN)). The cells could proliferate on the polymer surfaces, and the fold change of cell number after 16 days of culture reached to 1.93 +/- 0.07 (PS), 3.38 +/- 0.11 (PC), 3.65 +/- 0.04 (PEI), 2.24 +/- 0.15 (PEU) and 3.36 +/- 0.09 (PSAN). Differences in cell apoptosis could be observed during the culture. After 7 days, the apoptosis of cells on PC, PEI and PSAN decreased to a level comparable to that on standard tissue culture plate (TCP). All of the tested polymers exhibited low cytotoxicity and allowed high cell viability. Compared to cells on TCP, cells on PC and PEI showed similar morphology, distribution as well as F-actin cytoskeleton organization, whereas cells on PSAN were distributed less evenly and cells on PEU were less oriented. Cells were more likely to form clusters on PS. Conclusively, we demonstrated the influence of polymer substrates on the cellular behaviour of MSCs, which could be included in the development of novel design concepts based on polymeric biomaterials.

TI Immunological evaluation of polystyrene and poly(ether imide) cell
   culture inserts with different roughness
SO CLINICAL HEMORHEOLOGY AND MICROCIRCULATION
AB For the successful clinical and biological application of polymers, their interaction with cells, tissues, and body fluids has to be well characterized.
   In order to investigate how the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of candidate biomaterials influence cell behaviours, the testing sample is usually placed in commercially available cell culture plates. Thus, not only the testing sample itself but also the culture dish material might influence the cell behaviour. Therefore, an insert system was created to exclude this influence and allow investigations of the testing material solely. In this study micropatterned inserts prepared from polystyrene (PS) as well as from poly(ether imide) (PEI) with three different roughness levels of i) R-q=0.12 mu m (PS) and 0.23 mu m (PEI); ii) R-q = 3.52 mu m (PS) and 3.92 mu m (PEI); and iii) R-q = 16.04 mu m (PS) and 22.65 mu m (PEI) were explored with regard of their immuno-compatibility including the determination of potential contaminations with endotoxins or other microbial products.
   The endotoxin levels of the inserts were determined to be less than 0.07 EU/mL, which is well below the U. S. Food and Drug Administration limit of 0.5 EU/mL and the survival of murine macrophages cultured in the inserts was not impaired. Activation of early immune mechanisms such as complement activation and the generation of reactive oxygen species could not be observed. All tested materials had no influence on the cytokine secretion from cells of whole human blood.
   The investigated inserts were immuno-compatible and apparently free of contaminations with microbial products. The roughness of the inserts had no stimulatory or inhibitory effect on early immune mechanisms.
   Conclusively, the 24-well plate insert systems introduced in this study allow investigating the interactions of tailored surface properties such as roughness with many other cell types, without the disadvantage of the standard commercially available culture vessels influencing the biomaterial testing.

AB While nano-hydroxyapatite (nano-HAP) has been well known for series of amazing properties in chemical or physical, the controversy on the risks of its applications has also been existed. The worries of nano-HAP applications in preclinic and clinic indicate the blank researches of nano-HAP pharmacodynamics. It is important and necessary to trace and clarify the localizations of HAP nanoparticles in vivo. In the present paper, F-18 is used as radiotracer for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of HAP nanoparticles. Through the transverse plane slices and three-dimensional reconstruction pictures, it is very clear to observe the localization of nano-HAP in vivo at real time. Most nano-HAP particles were noted in organs lump, liver, spleen, stomach and existed for period of time.

AB Ti-6Al-4V ELI (Extra Low Interstitial) alloy have been widely used as alternative bone due to its excellent biocompatibility, although it still has many problems such as high elastic modulus and toxic. Therefore, biomaterial with low elastic modulus and nontoxic has to be developed. In this study, the raw materials which are nontoxic elements such as Nb and Mo were mixed and milled in a mixing machine (24h) and a high energy mechanical ball milling machine (1h, 4h and 8h) respectively. Ti-Nb-Mo-CPP composites were fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS) at 1000 degrees C under 70MPa using mixed and milled powders. The effects of CPP contents and milling time on biocompatibility and mechanical property have been investigated. By X-ray diffraction (XRD), chemical reaction during the sintering was occurred and revealed new phases, Ti2O, CaO, CaTiO3, and TixPy. Vickers hardness of composites increases with increase milling time and addition of CPP contents. Biocompatibility of CPP added Ti-Nb-Mo alloys were improved.

   Characterization, Histological and Histomorphometric Study on Soft
   Tissue Response
SO CONNECTIVE TISSUE RESEARCH
AB Maxillofacial, orthopedic, oral, and plastic surgery require materials for tissue augmentation, guided regeneration, and tissue engineering approaches. In this study, the aim was to develop and characterize a new extrudable hydrogel, based on agarose gel (AG; 1.5% wt) and to evaluate the local effects after subcutaneous implantation in comparison with collagen and hyaluronic acid. AG chemical-physical properties were ascertained through Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and rheological analysis. In vivo subcutaneous implants were performed, and histological and histomorphometric evaluations were done at 1, 4, 12, and 16 weeks. FT-IR confirmed that spectroscopic properties were the same for the baseline agarose and rheological characterization established that AG is a weak hydrogel. Subcutaneous AG implants induced new vessels and fibrous tissue formation rich in neutrophils; the capsule thickness around AG increased until the 12th week but remained thinner than those around hyaluronic acid and collagen. At 16 weeks, the thickness of the capsule significantly decreased around all materials. This study confirmed that 1.5% wt AG possesses some of the most important features of the ideal biocompatible material: safety, effectiveness, costless, and easily obtained with specific chemical and geometrical characters; the AG can represent a finely controllable and biodegradable polymeric system for cells and drug delivery applications.

AB Nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) films were synthesized using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition procedure with the CH4/Ar/H-2 gas mixture on silicon substrate at moderate temperatures in the present study. The characteristics of NCD films were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, optical emission spectroscopy and optical contact angle meter. The analytical results revealed that C-2 radial was the dominant species in the deposited process. From TEM observation the NCD films was formed via the etching of hydrocarbons and a small amount of hydrogen content additive into gas mixture could improve the aggregation of the nucleation film to form the NCD films. A (crystalline > amorphous-like > nanocrystalline structure) transition occurred during formation of NCD films. The more hydrophobic surfaces implied that NCD films were the potential biomaterial in the application of article heart valve or stent. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Effect of sandblasting on the mechanical properties of Y-TZP zirconia
SO BIO-MEDICAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Surface modification techniques affect phase transformation which in turn influences strength of zirconia biomaterial. The study aimed at evaluating the tetragonal to monoclinic (t-m) phase transition of zirconia occurring after sandblasting three different ceramic abrasive materials and its subsequent effect on the strength. Zirconia bars (n = 24) were sandblasted using silicon carbide (SiC), alumina (Al2O3) and zirconia (ZrO2) particles. After surface characterization by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a laser profilometer, the relative amount of transformed monoclinic (m) phase was analyzed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and its corresponding effect on the flexural strength and fatigue strength were determined. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance ANOVA (p < 0.05). Furthermore, Weibull statistics was used to analyze the variability of flexural strength. The highest amount of monoclinic content was found after sandblasting with SiC consequently resulting in an increased flexural strength and fracture resistance under cyclic load conditions. Weibull modulus was reduced in all the groups with SiC blasting showing the least degradation of m values. The strengthening mechanism that is attributed to sandblasting procedure is influenced by the abrasive material used.

AB Hydroxyapatite (HA) is the major component of the natural hard tissues such as teeth and bone. It has been studied extensively as a candidate biomaterial for its use in prosthetic applications. However, the main weakness of this material lies in its poor mechanical strength which makes it unsuitable for load-bearing applications. On the other hand zirconia (ZrO2) powder has been widely studied because of its high strength and fracture toughness and good biocompatibility. Therefore, the addition of zirconia phase into HA will improve the mechanical properties and biocompatibility of HA ceramics. The present study focused on coating of HA-ZrO2 on commercially pure titanium (cp-Ti) using novel biomimetic sol-gel method. The HA-ZrO2 coatings produced with BSG method were exhibited highly crystalline and pure structure. The coating thickness of the samples was not significantly influenced by the change in gelatin concentration and volume. It was concluded that the suggested coating method is a useful method to produce a biomimetic coating layer on the cp-Ti sample surfaces.

TI Synthesis of an activated phosphonated bifunctional chelate with
   potential for PET imaging and radiotherapy
SO ORGANIC & BIOMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY
AB The synthesis of a phosphonated acyclic bifunctional chelate L* for the labeling of biomaterial is described. L* is based on a pyridine backbone, functionalized in ortho positions by aminomethyl-bis-methylphosphonic acids, and, in the para position, by a side chain containing a reactive NHS carbamate function. The stability of L* in aqueous solutions at different pH values was studied by mass spectrometry, showing the activated function to be sensitive to hydrolysis above neutral pH. The reactivity of L* towards amine functions was tested using ethylamine under different conditions of pH and concentrations, and by the labeling of two reference peptides containing both an N-terminal amino function and a e-amino group of a lysine residue in the backbone, and a supplementary thiol group of a cysteine residue for one of these two peptides. The results showed the coupling to be efficient at pH 8.0, with a total selectivity for the terminal amine function with respect to lysine and cysteine. The labeling was further performed on B28-13, a mouse monoclonal antibody specifically recognizing tenascin-C protein in human cancer. The labeled antibody was characterized by means of mass spectrometry and spectrofluorimetry, unraveling a labeling ratio of one chelate per antibody. Finally, the affinity of the labeled antibody towards its target was controlled by immunofluorescence staining experiments on human colon cancer biopsies, confirming the affinity of the labeled peptide for tenascin-C.

AB Silk fibroin is regarded as a biomaterial for a long time. The fantastic biocompatibility of silk fibroin makes it a hot spot in the biomedical area and many researches has chosen it as a basic material to create new biomaterials. However, it has a long biodegradation period in body. Gamma ray is a method to accelerate degradation of other material in some experiments. This research combines silk fibroin with gamma ray and tries to figure out whether gamma ray can make the biodegradation of silk fibroin shorten. In this article, we give various doses of gamma ray to silk fibroin films and take some measurements about the mechanical and molecular structure of post-radiated silk fibroin, thus to choose an appropriate dose for the future research.

SO SOFT MATTER
AB Periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs), an important class of inorganic-organic functional hybrid materials, find numerous potential applications in nano-and biotechnologies due to their porous nature, large surface area (internal and external surfaces) and the structural diversity of their organosilica frameworks. In this contribution we report on the selective functionalization of both the internal and the external surfaces of PMOs with a fluorescent dye and bioactive molecules, respectively. Subsequently we used these unique bifunctionalized PMO nanoparticles for the preparation of non-patterned and patterned self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on glass. In cell experiments we showed that these new biomaterial surfaces enhance cell adhesion. We were able to determine the position of the inside dye substituted PMOs of the biomolecule functionalized surface in relation to the position of the stained cells by fluorescence microscopy as well. Patterned SAMs of bifunctionalized PMOs lead to selective cellular patterning along the stripes (texture of the surface).

Thanks to microtechnologies, this approach is able to sense biomaterials down to living cells size without invasivity. Broadband dielectric spectroscopy of living cells suspension is consequently demonstrated sketching a rich EM signature. Capacitive contrasts of 4% and 12% between cells suspension and pure medium are measured at 20 and 40GHz respectively. This analyzing technique consequently represents a promising integrated solution compatible with Lab-on-Chip (LoC) applications.

By immersion Mg 1%Ca alloys in HF, the layer of MgF2 was constituted on the surface of alloy and this layer improves the corrosion and causes weight gain. The results show that in order to get a better corrosion resistance, surface treatment should be done in 40% of HF, because the weight gain is more than other HF concentrations.

In this research, porous Ti-6Al-4V was fabricated by using powder sintering method with ammonium bicarbonate powders as space holder. The space holder decomposes to gases like ammonia, carbon dioxide and water at comparatively low temperature. The advantages of this pore holder and its decomposition products are that they have no contamination to host powders, and harmless to sintering machine. Green bodies with different weight ratio of pore holder and host powder are prepared, and then the pore holders are fully removed by heating at 200 degrees C. Porosity, density, compressive strength and modulus of the sintered porous Ti-6Al-4V are tested.

AB Previous studies have shown positive effects of Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) on the repair of bone defects, but there is a few that associates bone healing in the presence of a metabolic disorder such as Diabetes Mellitus, a systemic disorder associated to impair of the repair of different tissues. The aim of this study was to assess, histologically, the repair of surgical defects created in the femur of diabetic and non-diabetic rats treated or not with LLLT (lambda 780nm, 70mW, CW, circle divide similar to 0.4mm, 16J/cm(2) per session) associated or not to the use of a biomaterial. Surgical tibial bone defects were created in 60 animals that were divided into 4 groups: Group B (non-diabetic + biomaterial); Group BL (non-diabetic + biomaterial + LLLT); Group BD (diabetic + biomaterial); Group BDL (diabetic + biomaterial + LLLT). The irradiated group received 16 J/cm(2) per session divided into 4 points around the defect, being the first irradiation carried out immediately after surgery and repeated every 48h for 14 days. The animals were killed 15, 21 and 30 days after surgery. The specimens underwent a semi-quantitative analysis. The results showed inflammation more intense in the BD and BDL groups than in the B and BL groups in the period of 15 days (p = 0.02), however the cortical repair in the BDL group was below 25% in more than half of the specimens, while in the BD group, the repair was more than to 25% in all specimens. At 30 days, both osteoblastic activity and collagen deposition were significantly higher in the B group when compared to the BD group (p=0.04). Bone deposition was significantly higher in the BL group (p=0.023) than in BDL group. It is concluded that LLLT has a positive biomodulative effect in the early stages of the healing process of bone defects grafted with biomaterial in diabetic and non-diabetic rats.

AB The Ti-15Mo alloy is a promising material for use as a biomaterial because of its excellent corrosion resistance and its good combination of mechanical properties, such as fatigue, hardness, and wears resistance. This alloy has a body-centered predominantly cubic crystalline structure and the addition of interstitial atoms, such as oxygen and nitrogen, strongly alters its mechanical properties. Mechanical spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study the interaction of interstitial elements with the matrix metal or substitutional solutes, providing information such as the distribution and the concentration of interstitial elements. The objective of this paper is to study of the effects of heavy interstitial elements, such as oxygen and nitrogen, on the anelastic properties of the Ti-15Mo alloy by using mechanical spectroscopy measurements. In this study, the diffusion coefficients, pre-exponential factors, and activation energies were calculated for the oxygen in the Ti-15Mo alloy.

AB Titanium alloys are favorable implant materials for orthopedic applications, due to their desirable properties such as good corrosion resistance, low elasticity modulus, and excellent biocornpatibility. The research on titanium alloys is concentrated in the beta type, as the Ti-20Mo alloys and the addition of interstitial elements in these metals cause changes in their mechanical properties. The mechanical spectroscopy measurements have been frequently used in order to verify the behavior of these interstitials atoms in metallic alloys. This paper presents the study of oxygen diffusion in Ti-20Mo alloys using mechanical spectroscopy measurements. A thermally activated relaxation structure was observed in the sample after oxygen doping. It was associated with the interstitial diffusion of oxygen atoms in a solid solution in the alloy. The diffusion coefficient for the oxygen diffusion in the alloy was obtained by the frequency dependence of the peak temperature and by using a simple mathematical treatment of the relaxation structure and the Arrhenius law.

AB Calcium phosphate bone cement (CPC), a ceramic material, is commonly used as a biomaterial for the restoration of bone injuries. This study creates the composite scaffolds by mixing CPC with various amounts of polylactide fibers. Then, the resulting scaffolds are observed and tested in terms of the morphology, compressive strength, and fiber distribution, respectively, to explore the influence of the addition of polylactide fibers on the scaffolds. According to the experimental result, the compressive strength of the scaffolds increases as a result of an increase in the addition of fibers.

AB Polyurethanes (PU) have been widely used as biomaterial in recent years, while thrombus may still occur when contacting with blood especially for extended period of time. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and phosphorylcholine (PC)-based polymers are commonly employed for surface modification to create protein repellent surfaces. PC-based polymers have been investigated as biomimetic materials because PC is the major component in the outer layer of cell membranes. In this study, the biomimetic copolymer brush of PEG-b-poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) on PU surfaces was synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) with a surface initiator. The flexible PEG chain was 200 g.mol-1, while the poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (poly(MPC)) chain length was controlled by the ratio of monomer to sacrificial initiator in solution. The topology of the modified surfaces was characterized by the phase image of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study the synergy effect between PEG chains and poly(MPC) chains. The unmodified and modified surfaces were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), water contact angle and platelet adhesion. The results demonstrated that efficient grafting of PEG-b-poly(MPC) brushes on the surfaces was achieved. The PU surfaces modified with PEG and phosphorylcholine zwitterionic brushes showed effective resistance to platelet adhesion and high hemocompatibility in vitro. These PEG and PC-grafted PU materials might be potentially applied in blood-contacting materials or devices due to their good mechanical and hemocompatible properties.

TI Bioactivity Characterization of Amorphous Silica Ceramics Derived from

SO SILICON
AB Rice husk ash has been used to prepare amorphous silica bioactive ceramics. Three varieties of silica powders, namely brown ash, white ash and silica gel containing 96.0, 99.8 and 99.9% silica respectively, were used to prepare silica ceramics. The bioactivity and biodegradability properties of these ceramics were evaluated. The formation of crystalline apatite was observed on all the specimens in simulated body fluid. The phase composition, morphology and calcium/phosphorous ratio of the apatite layer formed were evaluated by X-ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy. Controlled biodegradability of amorphous silica in Tris buffer solution was found. These results suggest that the amorphous silica derived from rice husk ash is a promising and cost effective biomaterial.

TI E-Glass Fiber Reinforced Composites in Dental Applications
SO SILICON
AB Fiber reinforced composites (FRCs) are more and more widely applied in dentistry to substitute for metallic restorations: periodontal splints, fixed partial dentures, endodontic posts, orthodontic appliances, and some other indirect restorations. In general in FRCs, the fiber reinforcement provides the composite structure with better biomechanical performance due to their superior properties in tension and flexure. Nowadays, the E-glass fiber is most frequently used because of its chemical resistance and relatively low cost. Growing interest is being paid to enhance its clinical performance. Moreover, various techniques are utilized to reinforce the adhesion between the fiber and the matrix. Oral conditions set special requirements and challenges for the clinical applications of FRCs. The biomechanical properties of dental materials are of high importance in dentistry, and given this, there is on-going scientific interest to develop E-glass fiber reinforced composite systems. FRCs are generally biocompatible and their toxicity is not a concern.

TI Mucosal Vaccine Design and Delivery
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL 14
SE Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering
AB Mucosal surfaces are a major portal of entry for many human pathogens that are the cause of infectious diseases worldwide. Vaccines capable of eliciting mucosal immune responses can fortify defenses at mucosal front lines and protect against infection. However, most licensed vaccines are administered parenterally and fail to elicit protective mucosal immunity. Immunization by mucosal routes may be more effective at inducing protective immunity against mucosal pathogens at their sites of entry. Recent advances in our understanding of mucosal immunity and identification of correlates of protective immunity against specific mucosal pathogens have renewed interest in the development of mucosal vaccines. Efforts have focused on efficient delivery of vaccine antigens to mucosal sites that facilitate uptake by local antigen-presenting cells to generate protective mucosal immune responses. Discovery of safe and effective mucosal adjuvants are also being sought to enhance the magnitude and quality of the protective immune response.

AB Efforts in the interdisciplinary field of bioengineering have led to innovative methods for investigating the complexities of cell responses in vitro. These approaches have emphasized the reduction of complex multicomponent cellular microenvironments into distinct individual signals as a means to both (a) better construct mimics of in vivo microenvironments and (b) better deconstruct microenvironments to study them. Microtechnology tools, together with advances in biomaterials, have been fundamental to this progress by enabling the tightly controlled presentation of environmental cues and the improved systematic analysis of cellular perturbations. In this review, we describe bioengineering approaches for controlling and measuring cell-environmental interactions in vitro, including strategies for high-throughput analysis. We also describe the mechanistic insights gained by the use of these novel tools, with associated applications ranging from fundamental biological studies, in vitro modeling of in vivo processes, and cell-based therapies.

AB Bone loss induced by inflammation is one of the complications after biomaterial implantation. There is no much data on expression of cytokines and defensins into the bone tissue around the implants in literature. The aim of this work was to investigate the distribution and appearance of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and beta - defensin (BD)-2, BD-3, BD-4 after the implantation of different biomaterials. Bone developing zones, signs of bone-implant contact and low expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1, IL-6 and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in experimental tissue with pure HAp and unburned HAp implants indicate a potential advantage of this material in terms of its biocompatibility over the other materials used in our study.

SO NANOMEDICINE: INFECTIOUS DISEASES, IMMUNOTHERAPY, DIAGNOSTICS,
   ANTIFIBROTICS, TOXICOLOGY AND GENE MEDICINE
SE Methods in Enzymology
AB The concept of nanomedicine has risen to be the future of medicine. Advantages of using nanoobjects as vectors for drug delivery systems are numerous, such as fewer side effects due to a low drug dose, and high specificity between drug and target. Unlike systemic therapy, targeting a specific target is more efficient and less costly. In inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease, the colon represents the targeted organ. A large number of drugs are candidates for loading into nanoparticles (NPs). Small molecules, such as tripeptides and siRNA, or larger molecules, such as proteins (hormones, antibodies (Ab), etc.), can be encapsulated alone or in a complex form inside the NPs. In our studies, once NPs are synthesized and loaded with anti-inflammatory compounds, they are delivered to the colon. An efficient technique has been developed for specific NP targeting to digestive tract regions, including the colon, using a hydrogel based on electrostatic interactions between positive ions and negative polysaccharides. An in situ double cross-linking process, mediated by Ca2+ and SO42-, of chitosan and alginate administered to the mouse gastrointestinal (GI) tract by double gavage, is used for gel formation. When the drug is given in NPs, NPs are targeted to the colon, and NP degradation by aggressive environmental conditions in the GI tract is significantly reduced. Using a biomaterial (hydrogel) associated with nanotechnology, lower doses of drug can be loaded efficiently and delivered to the colon to reduce colonic inflammation.

TI Analysis of human mesenchymal stem cells on a cross-linked

SO BIO-MEDICAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Biomimetic scaffolds, delivered to the patient with or without cell loading, can offer improved treatments for a range of damaged or diseased tissues. In this work we evaluated the capacity of a cross-linked collagen-based implant material (Permacol (TM)) to support the survival and growth of multipotent stromal cells or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for potential applications in soft-tissue reconstruction and compared it to uncross-linked collagen. We showed, using confocal imaging, histology, quantitative analysis of seeding efficiencies by the MTT assay and Live/Dead analysis, that Permacol (TM) supported the adherence, growth and survival of MSCs preserving a healthy cell phenotype. MSCs infiltrated both matrices, although migration rates were significantly higher on uncross-linked matrices for some donors. Our work demonstrates that Permacol (TM) could maintain human MSCs in long-term culture supporting its use as a cell-seeded biomaterial for durable and strong repair in tissue reconstruction.

   phosphate/poly-DL-lactide-co-glycolide in simulated body fluid
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED BIOMATERIALS & FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Simulated body fluid (SBF) is an artificial fluid which has ionic composition and ionic concentration similar to human blood plasma.
   Purpose: This paper compares the interaction between the nanomaterial containing calcium phosphate/poly-DL-lactide-co-glycolide (N-CP/PLGA) and SBF, in order to investigate whether and to what extent inorganic ionic composition of human blood plasma leads to the aforementioned changes in the material.
   Methods: N-CP/PLGA was incubated for 1, 2, 3, and 5 weeks in SBF. The surface of the material was analyzed on SEM-EDS and FTIR spectrometer, while SBF was subjected to pH and electrical conductivity measurement.
   Results: Our results indicate that dissolution of the polymer component of the material N-CP/PLGA and precipitation of the material similar to hydroxyapatite on its surface are based on the morphologic changes seen in this material.
   Conclusions: The mechanism of the apatite formation on the bioceramic surface was intensively studied and was considered crucial in designing the new biomaterials. The results obtained in this work indicate that N-CP/PLGA may be a good candidate for application to bone regeneration.

As a rapid-prototyping technique, two-photon polymerization enables the fabrication of truly arbitrary three-dimensional micro- and nano-structures directly from computer models, with a spatial resolution down to 100 nm. In this review, we discuss the fundamentals, experimental methods, and materials used for two-photon polymerization; in addition, we present some applications of this technology related to microfluidics and to biomaterial scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

AB Magnesium has gained interest as a biomaterial for orthopedic applications because of its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and positive effect on bone formation. Likewise, studies have shown nanophase material increase osteoblast (bone-forming cell) function compared to conventional materials, but the two have not been studied together. The purpose of this study was to determine if altering magnesium surface features into the nanometer scale promotes greater osteoblast functions. Nanorough magnesium surfaces were created by a novel treatment with sodium hydroxide at 1N, 5N, and 10N concentrations for 10, 20, and 30 minutes. Material characterization by scanning electron microscopy showed increased roughness on all treated samples compared to the control magnesium. Contact angle measurements indicated greater hydrophilicity on treated magnesium and no significant effect of ultraviolet sterilization on the surface energy of the material. Osteoblasts were seeded onto treated and untreated surfaces and adhesion at 4hrs were assessed through the MTT assay. Results indicated increased osteoblast adhesion on nano-treated samples compared to untreated samples. These findings support previous studies indicating the promise of magnesium as a biomaterial for orthopedic applications and suggest further experiments examining the long-term effects of nanophase magnesium on osteoblast proliferation and function.

AB Mechanically handling of compliant bio-structures has been attracting growing attention due to the needs to automate processing of natural products. To understand the effect of bio-structural deformation on the blade location/force in poultry industry where high yield breast meats are harvested at production speed, biomaterial properties must be obtained before a nominal bio-structure model can be built for lumped parameter control of the process. This paper proposes a simple yet effective approach for obtaining the mechanical properties of biomaterials with a beam-like structure. A 3D curvature based beam model (CBM) with all its state variables described in global coordinates is developed for analyzing the large deformation of a compliant beam. The computationally efficient model without significantly scarifying accuracy has been verified numerically against a finite-element model. To illustrate its practicality, the CBM with cantilever constraints has been employed to analytically determine the nominal values of the elastic modulus and fracture strength from eight chicken-clavicle samples. While this paper is written in the context of wing manipulation for automatic de-boning process, the method can be used in other bioengineering applications involving flexible beam-like elements.

AB Calcium silicate (CS), the recent developed biodegradable ceramic, shows potential in stimulating bone regeneration. However, the rapid degradation restricts its further application, that is, the cytotoxicity is highly suspicious. In this study, the attempt with the addition of strontium by partially replacing the site of calcium shows appropriate, not only enhancing the bioactivity of CS, but also promoting its biocompatibility. Thus, the modification of biomaterial by strontium seems to be an effective approach for biological application.

AB Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is known as a kind of bioactive and biocompatible material, HAP coatings are used to improve the biocompatibility of substrate by some researchers. In this paper, homogenous precipitation of hydroxyapatite was formed in the system of CaNa(2)EDTA -(NH4)(2)HPO4-NH4OH-H2O, and HAP powder was obtained after calcinations at 800 degrees C and grinding. Add HAP in UHMWPE o-xylene solution to get dipping solution and prepare HAP/UHMWPE-coated titanium by dipping coating process. Scratch test demonstrated that Ti-HAP/UHMWPE material started to shine metallic luster under 1.03 N, and adhesive strength is 32MPa. UHMWPE not only simplified the process of preparing HAP-coated material, but also enhanced the adhesive strength, which shows great potential in biomedical areas.

TI Fabrication of biomimetic poly(propylene carbonate) scaffolds by using
   carbon dioxide as a solvent, monomer and foaming agent
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
AB The aim of this study was to develop an environmentally friendly process for the fabrication of three dimensional (3D) biomimetic scaffolds from biodegradable poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC). Prior to production of scaffolds, PPC was synthesized using a one-pot process in which the zinc glutarate catalyst was first fabricated in a supercritical CO2 system. The scaffolds were then prepared by gas foaming/salt leaching followed by aminolysis and layer-by-layer (LBL) gelatin assembly on the surface. The pore size and interconnectivity were controlled by the variation of gas foaming process parameters such as temperature, CO2 pressure, depressurization rate and particle size of salt (NaCl). The pore size was within the range of 116 + 53 to 418 + 84 mu m and the porosity was between 69.8 and 92.3%. The results of micro-CT scan analysis demonstrated that porosity and pore interconnectivity were enhanced by increasing the pore size. However, the compressive modulus of hydrated scaffolds was decreased from 380 +/- 90 to 200 +/- 50 kPa, when the pore size was increased from 232 +/- 91 to 411 +/- 108 mu m. The results of fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that gelatin was uniformly deposited on the 3D scaffolds. Surface modification of hydrophobic PPC scaffolds substantially increased the fibroblast cells attachment, penetration, and proliferation. The results of this study demonstrated the feasibility of eliminating toxic organic solvents in the synthesis of a solid based catalyst and processing PPC polymer into tissue scaffolds. The clean technology developed will be of great value for large scale production of biodegradable PPC that can be used for many purposes such as packaging products and plastic bags. In addition, it was shown that PPC can be considered as an alternative biomaterial for tissue engineering applications.

TI Microstructures and Mechanical Properties of Ternary Ti-10Cr-(V, Fe, Mo)
   Alloys with Self-tunable Young's Moduli for Biomedical Applications
SO ISIJ INTERNATIONAL
AB Ternary beta-type Ti-10Cr-(V, Fe, Mo) alloys with self-tunable Young's moduli were subjected to solution treatment and cold rolling, and their microstructures and mechanical properties were investigated. During cold rolling, a band-like structure, which is considered to be {332},(beta)< 113 >(beta) mechanical twin, and deformation-induced omega phase are formed in alloys with certain chemical compositions. The number of bands increases with an increase in the cold-rolling reduction ratio and V content as well as with a decrease in Mo content. On the other land, the Young's modulus increases during cold rolling, and the increase in Young's modulus is considered to be caused by the deformation-induced omega phase transformation. Furthermore, the tensile strength decreases slightly and the elongation tends to increase with an increase in the alloying element contents, while the effect of the V and Mo contents on the trend in changing the number of mechanical twin is opposite. These tensile properties are derived from the complicated factors among the plastic deformation mode, the type of mechanical twinning, and deformation-induced omega phase transformation, depending on the beta stability and the kind of alloying element.

AB Silk fibroin (SF) and P-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) had been used in biomedical applications for these years. The potential of silk and beta-TCP for application in tissue engineering is currently being explored. The purpose of this study was to prepare and characterize a 3D scaffold consisting of nano-beta-TCP/SF composite.
   XRD and FT-IR analysis showed that predominant crystalline phase of calcium phosphate was beta-TCP; a chelate effect between SF and Ca2+ was happened at complexing period of SF and beta-TCP. The compressive strength of nano-beta-TCP/SF composite was 42 MPa +/- 0.12 MPa. In vitro cell cultivation experiment showed that the composite was a good matrix for the growth of osteoblasts. Conclusion: the incorporation of SF into nano-beta-TCP can enhance both mechanical strength and bioactivity of the scaffold, which suggests that the beta-TCP/SF composite may be a potential biomaterial for tissue engineering.

AB Due to size limits in the transverse direction, tensile testing is not appropriate to investigate the mechanical properties of elytra cuticle of the dung beetle (Copris ochus Motschulsky). However, nanoindentation testing can determine a material's anisotropic properties through a single indentation. En the present study, nanoindentation stress strain curves were used to characterize the complete mechanical behavior of dung beetle elytra cuticle. A differential constitutive equation has been developed with time-dependent spring constants k and viscosities To describe the complex viscoelastic behavior of dung beetle cuticle, a descriptive representation of the linear viscoelasticity law for the multilayer matrix has been formulated. A qualitative model for the relationship between cuticle structure and mechanical properties of elytra may help develop bionic composite materials for micro-aircraft, bionic tribology, bionic medical apparatus, and bionic organs (tissue engineering).

SO BRATISLAVA MEDICAL JOURNAL-BRATISLAVSKE LEKARSKE LISTY
AB The objective of this study is to radiologically evaluate the effects of biphasic calcium phosphate scaffold with 5, 10 and 20 percentage of porosity on cortical bone repair in rabbits. In this study, 28 male white rabbits were examined. Rabbits were divided into four groups. After induction of general anesthesia, a segmental bone defect of 10 mm in length was created in the middle of the right radius shaft. In group A, the defect was stabilized with miniplate and 2 screws and left untreated. In groups B, C and D tricalcium phosphate scaffold mixed with hydroxyapatite (TCP+HA) with 5%, 10% and 20% porosity was used to fill the bone defect. Bone regeneration and HA+TCP scaffold resorption were assessed by X-ray at 1, 2 and 3 months after the surgery. In group A, 3 months after surgery, periosteal callus was not found but intercortical callus was observed. In groups B and C, 3 months after surgery medullary bridging callus and intercortical callus were found, periosteal callus was not found, TCP+HA scaffold were observed. In group D, 2 months after the surgery, medullary bridging callus and intercortical callus were found, 3 months later, periosteal callus was not found, most of scaffold had disappeared and were unclear and partial bone formation was recognized. Differences observed in radiological findings were significant between group A and groups B, C, D. Differences between groups B and C were not significant, but between group D and groups B and C were significant. The results of this study showed that TCP+HA scaffold is an osteoconductive and osteoinductive biomaterial. Scaffold of TCP+HA can increase the amount of newly formed bone and more rapid regeneration of bone defects. These results suggest TCP+HA scaffold may considerably be used in the treatment of cortical bone defect and other orthopaedic defects PCL (Tab. 2, Fig. 4, Ref. 20). Full Text in PDF www.elis.sk.

   oxide incorporated magnetic mesoporous silica
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB On the basis of a thermal process, a facile, low cost, one-step approach for preparing iron oxide (Fe2O3) incorporated ordered magnetic mesoporous silica nanocomposites by a co-operative self-assembly approach is presented. Various mesostructured silica materials incorporated with different amounts of iron oxide (nSi/nFe = 1/1, 1/0.5, 1/0.25 and 1/0.123) at various pH (<1, 3, 5 and 7) were synthesized and characterized by electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry. Further, the surface area and magnetic properties were evaluated using N-2-sorption analyses, and a superconducting quantum interference device interfaced with a vibrating sample magnetometer (SQUID-VSM) respectively. The transmission electron micrographs and nitrogen sorption analysis indicated that most of the Fe2O3 domains of several nanometers were embedded in the silica walls, rather than dispersed in the mesopores. The incorporation of iron oxide into the mesopores without compromising the structural and textural properties was achieved at pH < 1. These structures have great potential in diagnostics and therapeutics. However, the acceptance of this material by the biological host is a critical issue for such biomedical applications. In this study, we have also evaluated the in vivo biocompatibility of these magnetic mesoporous materials in a rat model. The histopathological results show that this magnetic material can be classified as a level 2 biomaterial that can be safely used for short term applications such as MRI imaging, hyperthermia, targeted drug delivery, etc.

Batch experiments were performed by taking 0.1 g of oven dried biomass of biosorbent in 250 mL flask containing 100 mL of 1 mg L-1 of As(V) solution at 150 rpm for 1 hour. The experiment was laid out as a completely randomized design with three replicates. Results indicates that all six adsorbents hold significantly greater adsorption capacity (0.99 mg g(-1)) and efficiency (99%) for capturing As(V) from the aqueous solution. Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) study revealed the involvement of carbohydrates and proteins groups like hydroxyl, amine, amide and carbonyl in metal sequestration. Adsorption based experiments summarized that agricultural wastes are potential easily available low-cost biomaterial for adsorption of As(V) ions from the aqueous phase.

TI Antioxidative/oxidative effects of strontium-doped bioactive glass as
   bone graft. In vivo assays in ovariectomised rats
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED BIOMEDICINE
AB Recently, oxidative stress has been identified as a pivotal pathological factor inducing bone osteoporosis. This phenomenon is responsible for low bone density. It alters bone quality and generates bone fractures. Strontium is found to induce osteoblast activity by stimulating bone formation and reducing bone resorption by restraining osteoclasts. Bioglass (BG) has been used to repair bone defects, and, in combination with strontium (BG-Sr), offers an opportunity to treat this disease. This study investigated the potential role of BG-Sr in improving antioxidant activity and regenerative bone capacity, The effects of both BG-Sr and BG were tested on osteoblast SaOS2 and endothelial EAhy926 cell proliferation in vitro. In vivo, BG-Sr and BG were implanted in the femoral condyles of Wistar rats and compared to that of control groups. Cell proliferation increased significantly by 120% at SaOS2 and 127% at EAhy926. Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT) and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) were significantly enhanced in BG-Sr treated rats compared to other groups. Moreover, a significant decrease of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARs) was observed. The Ca/P ratio increase improved progressive bone mineralization. According to these results, BG-Sr ameliorated cell proliferation and developed an antioxidative defense against ROS. The histological findings highlight the BG-Sr implications in the osteoporosis treatment confirmed by bone construction. The development of BG-Sr as a therapeutic biomaterial protecting against oxidative stress might make an effective choice for application in tissue engineering.

TI Assessment of a Chitosan/Hyaluronan Injectable Composite for Fat
   Reconstruction
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB The long-term success of autologous fat transplants is dependent on numerous factors including tissue quality, tissue survivability and the expansion of the implanted cells. The addition of a biomaterial filler to an injectable gel implant matrix provides an anchor and scaffold for proliferating cells as well as a carrier for syringe delivery. Building on the tissue reconstruction concept which we first disclosed, i.e., an injectable composite comprised of beads in a gel, the present study uses an injectable composite comprised of fatty-acid-loaded chitosan/gelatin (FA-CG) beads (i.e., a degradable filler material with tissue bulking potential) and hyaluronic acid (HA, a matrix). Human and bovine preadipocytes were considered independently; however, in both cases the cells proliferated and differentiated equally when grown with the FA-CG/HA composite, as demonstrated by the production of lipids and triglycerides, as well as expression of the human adipocyte marker aP2. The preadipocyte/FA-CG/HA injectables formed stable complexes that remained intact, with little degradation and no measurable immune response, for 4 months after implantation into mice. These results suggest that FA-CG/HA composite is a suitable injectable matrix for preadipocyte transplantation, providing the basis for further studies investigating the suitability of this technique for larger-scale tissue implantation and regeneration.

TI Magnetic Drug Targeting as New Therapeutic Option for the Treatment of
   Biomaterial Infections
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB Implant-associated infections are a challenging problem in surgery. Bacteria in biofilms are difficult to treat as they are less susceptible to antibiotics or antiseptics which require high drug concentrations at the site of infection. We present a novel strategy to concentrate high antibiotic doses systemically at the target site using newly developed antibiotic-functionalized nanoparticles directed by a magnetic drug-targeting system. The important and effective antibiotic gentamicin served as antimicrobial substance and was ionically or covalently attached to magnetic nanoparticles. Subsequently, the particles were characterized thoroughly. Anti-infective properties with regard to Staphylococcus aureus and the degree of cytotoxicity concerning human umbilical vein endothelial cells were determined. The enrichment of the magnetic nanoparticles at the surface of model tubes in circulatory experiments was investigated. We describe a promising technique for the loading of magnetic nanoparticles to treat systemic infections. Gentamicin-coated magnetic nanoparticles reduced bacterial growth even beyond pathologically relevant concentrations within 24 h.

TI Direct-write, Well-aligned Chitosan-Poly(ethylene oxide) Nanofibers
   Deposited via Near-field Electrospinning
SO JOURNAL OF MACROMOLECULAR SCIENCE PART A-PURE AND APPLIED CHEMISTRY
AB A continuous near-field electrospinning (NFES) process has been demonstrated to be able to achieve direct-write and well-aligned chitosan/poly(ethylene oxide) nanofibers. The ability to precisely control and deposit chitosan-based nanofibers in a direct-write manner is favorable in manipulating cells attachment and proliferation at a preferred position. Experimental results show that fiber diameters can be reliably controlled in the range of 265-1255 nm by adjusting various operating parameters of the NFES processes. These prescribed patterns of nanofibers exceed tens of centimeters long and complex configurations such as grid arrays and arc shapes are assembled at specified separations as small as 5 mu m. FTIR analysis reveals that NFES nanofibers have a similar morphology and composition as conventional electrospinning counterpart and constitute all components formerly present in the polymer solution. The versatile functionality to fabricate chitosan-based nanofibers with controllable size and directional alignment as well as highly ordered and customized patterns may represent an ideal candidate of a functional biomaterial and in tissue-engineering scaffolds that are predominantly representative of extracellular matrix (ECM).

TI Photoreactive elastin-like proteins for use as versatile bioactive
   materials and surface coatings
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB Photocrosslinkable, protein-engineered biomaterials combine a rapid, controllable, cytocompatible crosslinking method with a modular design strategy to create a new family of bioactive materials. These materials have a wide range of biomedical applications, including the development of bioactive implant coatings, drug delivery vehicles, and tissue engineering scaffolds. We present the successful functionalization of a bioactive elastin-like protein with photoreactive diazirine moieties. Scalable synthesis is achieved using a standard recombinant protein expression host followed by site-specific modification of lysine residues with a heterobifunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-diazirine crosslinker. The resulting biomaterial is demonstrated to be processable by spin coating, drop casting, soft lithographic patterning, and mold casting to fabricate a variety of two- and three-dimensional photocrosslinked biomaterials with length scales spanning the nanometre to millimetre range. Protein thin films proved to be highly stable over a three-week period. Cell-adhesive functional domains incorporated into the engineered protein materials were shown to remain active post-photo-processing. Human adipose-derived stem cells achieved faster rates of cell adhesion and larger spread areas on thin films of the engineered protein compared to control substrates. The ease and scalability of material production, processing versatility, and modular bioactive functionality make this recombinantly engineered protein an ideal candidate for the development of novel biomaterial coatings, films, and scaffolds.

TI Decreased bacteria activity on Si3N4 surfaces compared with PEEK or
   titanium
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE
AB A significant need exists for orthopedic implants that can intrinsically resist bacterial colonization. In this study, three biomaterials that are used in spinal implants - titanium (Ti), polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK), and silicon nitride (Si3N4) - were tested to understand their respective susceptibility to bacterial infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphlococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus. Specifically, the surface - chemistry, wettability, and nanostructured topography of respective biomaterials, and the effects on bacterial biofilm formation, colonization, and growth were investigated. Ti and PEEK were received with as-machined surfaces; both materials are hydrophobic, with net negative surface charges. Two surface finishes of Si3N4 were examined: as-fired and polished. In contrast to Ti and PEEK, the surface of Si3N4 is hydrophilic, with a net positive charge. A decreased biofilm formation was found, as well as fewer live bacteria on both the as- fired and polished Si3N4. These differences may reflect differential surface chemistry and surface nanostructure properties between the biomaterials tested. Because protein adsorption on material surfaces affects bacterial adhesion, the adsorption of fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin on Ti, PEEK, and Si3N4 were also examined. Significantly greater amounts of these proteins adhered to Si3N4 than to Ti or PEEK. The findings of this study suggest that surface properties of biomaterials lead to differential adsorption of physiologic proteins, and that this phenomenon could explain the observed in-vitro differences in bacterial affinity for the respective biomaterials. Intrinsic biomaterial properties as they relate to resistance to bacterial colonization may reflect a novel strategy toward designing future orthopedic implants.

AB Strengthening by grain refinement and increasing dislocation density through high-pressure torsion (HPT), which is an attractive technique to fabricate ultrafine grained and nanostructured metallic materials, is expected to provide beta-type Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr (TNTZ) higher mechanical strength while maintaining low Young's modulus because they keep the original beta phase. However, the ductility shows reverse trend. Greater strength with enhanced ductility can be achieved by controlling precipitated phases through HPT processing after aging treatment. Aged TNTZ subjected to HPT processing at high N exhibits a homogeneous microstructure with ultrafine elongated grains having a high dislocation density and consequently non-equilibrium boundaries and distorted subgrains with non-uniform shapes and nanostructured intergranular precipitates of alpha phases. Therefore, the effect of HPT processing on the microstructure and mechanical hardness of TNTZ after aging treatment was systematically investigated in this study. TNTZ, which was subjected to aging treatment at 723 K for 259.2 ks in vacuum followed by water quenching, subjected to HPT processing at rotation numbers (N) of 1 to 20 under a pressure of around 1.25 GPa at room temperature. The microstructure of TNTZ(AT) consisted of precipitated needle-like omega phases in beta grains. However, TNTZ(AHPT) at N >= 10 comprises very fine alpha and small amount omega phases in ultrafine beta grains. Furthermore, the hardness of every TNTZ(AHPT) was totally much greater than that of TNTZ(AT). The hardness increased from the center to peripheral region of TNTZ(AHPT). In addition, the tensile strength of every TNTZ(AHPT) was greater than that of TNTZ(AT). The tensile strength of TNIZ(AHPT) increased, but the elongation decreased with increasing N and then both of them saturated at N >= 10.

TI Effect of process parameters settings and thickness on surface roughness
   of EBM produced Ti-6Al-4V
SO RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL
AB Purpose - Ti-6Al-4V is one of the most attractive materials being used in aerospace, automotive and medical implant industries. Electron beam melting (EBM) is one of the direct digital manufacturing methods to produce complex geometries of fully dense and near net shape parts. The EBM system provides an opportunity to built metallic objects with different processing parameter settings like beam current, scan speed, probe size on powder, etc. The purpose of this paper is to determine and understand the effect of part's thickness and variation in process parameter settings of the EBM system on surface roughness/topography of EBM fabricated Ti-6Al-4V metallic parts.
   Design/methodology/approach - A mathematical model based upon response surface methodology (RSM) is developed to study the variation of surface roughness with changing process parameter settings. Surface roughness of the test slabs produced with different parameter settings and thickness has been studied under confocal microscope. Response surface methodology was used to develop a multiple regression model to correlate the effect of variation in EBM process parameters settings and thickness of parts on surface roughness of EBM produced Ti-6Al-4V.
   Findings - It has been observed that every part produced by EBM system has detectable surface roughness. The surface roughness parameter Ra varies between 1-20 mu m for different samples depending upon the process parameter setting and thickness. The Ra value increases with increasing sample thickness and beam current, and decreases with increase in offset focus and scan speed.
   Originality/value - Surface roughness is related to wear and friction property of the material and hence is related to the life time and performance of the part. Surface roughness is an important property of any material to be considered as biomaterial. The surface roughness of the material depends upon the manufacturing method and environment and hence it is controllable either during fabrication or by post processing. From the 1st order regression model developed in this study, it is also evident that sample thickness, scan speed and beam current have relatively more effect on roughness value then the offset focus. With the model obtained equation, a designer can subsequently select the best combination of sample thickness and process parameter values to achieve desired surface roughness.

TI Hydrogel crosslinking density regulates temporal contractility of human
   embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in 3D cultures
SO SOFT MATTER
AB Systematically tunable in vitro platforms are invaluable in gaining insight to stem cell-microenvironment interactions in three-dimensional cultures. Utilizing recombinant protein technology, we independently tune hydrogel properties to systematically isolate the effects of matrix crosslinking density on cardiomyocyte differentiation, maturation, and function. We show that contracting human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) remain viable within four engineered elastin-like hydrogels of varying crosslinking densities with elastic moduli ranging from 0.45 to 2.4 kPa. Cardiomyocyte phenotype and function was maintained within hESC embryoid bodies for up to 2 weeks. Interestingly, increased crosslinking density was shown to transiently suspend spontaneous contractility. While encapsulated cells began spontaneous contractions at day 1 in hydrogels of the lowest crosslinking density, onset of contraction was increasingly delayed at higher crosslinking densities for up to 6 days. However, once spontaneous contraction was restored, the rate of contraction was similar within all materials (71 +/- 8 beats per min). Additionally, all groups successfully responded to electrical pacing at both 1 and 2 Hz. This study demonstrates that encapsulated hESC-CMs respond to 3D matrix crosslinking density within elastin-like hydrogels and stresses the importance of investigating temporal cellular responses in 3D cultures.

AB Removal of moisture from biological materials, popularly called drying, has numerous benefits, including ease of handling due to reduction in bulk, resulting in reduced handling costs. Moreover, drying prevents microbial growth and spoilage. Though different drying techniques share a common objective, conceptually they are different and require modification/adaptation based on the biomaterial that is dried. There have been significant scientific advancements in the past century in the field of drying of foods, fibers, and fuel. This article will provide an extensive review of various drying pretreatments and different hybrid drying techniques, including supercritical and fluidized bed concepts, microwave drying, superheated steam drying, and heat pump drying to meet tomorrow's food and energy needs.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB Synthetic polymeric materials are established as being central to many modern approaches to medical treatments such as biomaterial induced tissue regeneration or drug eluting implants. Cytocompatible, antifouling materials, based on hydrophilic polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol), have been widely studied as a 'blank canvas' substrate; it is possible to apply various bioactive ligands to elicit specific tissue and cell responses. In recent years, branched polyglycerols have gained attention as a viable alternative to PEG as a protein-resistance providing chemical moiety. To this end we have embarked on the preparation of bulk polyglycerol-based films, which are readily synthesized from abundant starting materials, with the aim of evaluating their as yet undiscovered potential as macroscopic biomaterials. Herein we report syntheses, as well as mechanical, and rheological properties of a series of polyglycerol-based polymer networks. Polymeric films produced are highly crosslinked, have high thermal stability, and are flexible with thermal glass transition temperatures below body temperature.

TI HIGH THROUGHPUT GENERATED MICRO-AGGREGATES OF CHONDROCYTES STIMULATE
   CARTILAGE FORMATION IN VITRO AND IN VIVO
SO EUROPEAN CELLS & MATERIALS
AB Cell-based cartilage repair strategies such as matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) could be improved by enhancing cell performance. We hypothesised that micro-aggregates of chondrocytes generated in high-throughput prior to implantation in a defect could stimulate cartilaginous matrix deposition and remodelling. To address this issue, we designed a micro-mould to enable controlled high-throughput formation of micro-aggregates. Morphology, stability, gene expression profiles and chondrogenic potential of micro-aggregates of human and bovine chondrocytes were evaluated and compared to single-cells cultured in micro-wells and in 3D after encapsulation in Dextran-Tyramine (Dex-TA) hydrogels in vitro and in vivo. We successfully formed micro-aggregates of human and bovine chondrocytes with highly controlled size, stability and viability within 24 hours. Micro-aggregates of 100 cells presented a superior balance in Collagen type I and Collagen type II gene expression over single cells and micro-aggregates of 50 and 200 cells. Matrix metalloproteinases 1, 9 and 13 mRNA levels were decreased in micro-aggregates compared to single-cells. Histological and biochemical analysis demonstrated enhanced matrix deposition in constructs seeded with micro-aggregates cultured in vitro and in vivo, compared to single-cell seeded constructs. Whole genome microarray analysis and single gene expression profiles using human chondrocytes confirmed increased expression of cartilage-related genes when chondrocytes were cultured in micro-aggregates. In conclusion, we succeeded in controlled high-throughput formation of micro-aggregates of chondrocytes. Compared to single cell-seeded constructs, seeding of constructs with micro-aggregates greatly improved neocartilage formation. Therefore, micro-aggregation prior to chondrocyte implantation in current MACI procedures, may effectively accelerate hyaline cartilage formation.

TI Asymmetric Composite Membranes from Chitosan and Tricalcium Phosphate
   Useful for Guided Bone Regeneration
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB To fulfill the properties of barrier membranes useful for guided bone tissue regeneration in the treatment of periodontitis, in this study a simple process combining lyophilization with preheating treatment to produce asymmetric barrier membranes from biodegradable chitosan (CS) and functional beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) was proposed. By preheating TCP/CS (3: 10, w/w) in an acetic acid solution at 40 degrees C, a skin layer that could greatly increase the mechanical properties of the membrane was formed. The asymmetric membrane with a skin layer had a modulus value almost 4-times that of the symmetric porous membrane produced only by lyophilization. This is beneficial for maintaining a secluded space for the bone regeneration, as well as to prevent the invasion of other tissues. The subsequent lyophilization at -20 degrees C then gave the rest of material an interconnected pore structure with high porosity (83.9-90.6%) and suitable pore size (50-150 mu m) which could promote the permeability and adhesiveness to bone cells, as demonstrated by the in vitro cell-culture of hFOB1.19 osteoblasts. Furthermore, the TCP particles added to CS could further increase the rigidity and the cell attachment and proliferation of hFOB1.19. The TCP/CS asymmetric composite membrane thus has the potential to be used as the barrier membrane for guided bone regeneration. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2011

TI Combinatorial Effects of Charge Characteristics and Hydrophobicity of
   Silk Fibroin on the Sorption and Release of Charged Dyes
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB The present study was designed to examine the influence of the charge characteristics of silk fibroin on the sorption and release of charged dyes by varying the pH values of the sorption and release media as well as types of charged dyes. Negatively charged dyes (phenol red and chromotrope 2R) and positively charged dyes (crystal violet and indoine blue) were used as the model compounds. Silk fibroin films were prepared by using a solution casting technique. The prepared films were then treated with an aqueous methanol solution or annealed with water to control their conformation. The sorption behavior of the model compounds made by the methanol-treated and water-annealed silk fibroin films was investigated. Compared to the water-annealed silk fibroin films, a higher hydrophobicity of the methanol-treated silk fibroin films caused a higher sorption of the hydrophobic dyes. The dye molecules had a fairly high affinity to the silk fibroin film, even though the dye and the matrix possessed the same charge. However, in the presence of two charged groups in a single dye molecule, the electrostatic repulsion become more dominant. Stronger interaction was observed when the charges of the film and the dye were opposite. The results of dye sorption and release experiments showed that the degree of synergism or competition between electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions directly depended on the charges and chemical structure of the dye molecules and the environmental pH conditions of the existing silk fibroin film.

TI Coalescence of Extracellular Matrix (ECM) from Porcine Urinary Bladder
   (UBM) with a Laser-Activated Chitosan-Based Surgical Adhesive
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB Urinary bladder matrix (UBM) has been extensively investigated as a naturally occurring biomaterial in therapeutic applications for tissue repair or regeneration, while other strategies involve biopolymers such as chitosan for tissue reconstruction. The coalescence of UBM with chitosan has considerable potential in enhancing tissue reconstruction. Characterisation of a novel, laser-activated, chitosan-based, thin-film surgical adhesive with UBM in various morphologies showed that the films had increased surface rugosities and crystallinities (R-a approx. 0.83 mu m, approx. 12% crystallinity) when compared to the chitosan adhesive alone (R-a = 0.74 mu m, 7% crystallinity). Tensile strength of the films was significantly increased by the addition of UBM in particulate form (12.1-32.4 MPa). Furthermore, tissue adhesion strengths using these hybrid biomaterials were maintained at approx. 15 kPa compared to 3 kPa for fibrin glue. Histological analysis demonstrated that laser irradiation of the UBM-chitosan adhesive biomaterial caused no thermal damage to tissue. Examination of the cellular response at the material interface showed that 3T3 fibroblasts maintained their regular morphology with enhanced growth compared to films of both chitosan and its adhesive form. These results suggest that coalescence of UBM with a chitosan-based adhesive supports the development of biomaterial devices for sutureless wound closure that could enhance tissue repair and reconstruction.

TI Bioactive mesoporous calcium-silicate nanoparticles with excellent
   mineralization ability, osteostimulation, drug-delivery and
   antibacterial properties for filling apex roots of teeth
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB Bioactive materials are playing an important role in sealing apical root canals of teeth, inducing bone/cementum tissue regeneration and inhibiting bacterial viability. Conventional Ca(OH)(2) materials have limitations for filling apical root canals of teeth due to their low mineralization ability and potential cytotoxicity. The aim of this study is to prepare bioactive mesoporous calcium-silicate (MCS) nanoparticles for the potential application of filling an apical root canal of a tooth. The mesoporous structure, specific surface area, pore volume and morphology of MCS particles were characterized. The apatite-mineralization ability, in vitro osteogenesis, drug delivery and antibacterial properties were further investigated. The results showed that MCS nanoparticles (around 100 nm) with high specific surface area and pore volume were successfully prepared by a facile template method. The prepared MCS could be easily injected to fill the apical root canal of a tooth. MCS nanoparticles induced apatite-mineralization in DMEM solution, did not show cytotoxicity, and their ionic products could stimulate the proliferation of periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs). In contrast, conventional Ca(OH)(2) materials did not induce mineralization and showed significant cytotoxic effects on PDLCs. Furthermore, MCS extracts at low concentrations (12.5 and 25 mg mL(-1)) induced higher ALP activity of PDLCs than those at high concentrations (50 and 100 mg mL(-1)). In addition, MCS extracts significantly stimulated osteogenic gene expression (OPN, ALP and OCN) of PDLCs compared to a blank control, indicating the excellent osteostimulation property of MCS. MCS nanoparticles could be used for loading the antibiotic ampicillin due to their mesoporous microstructures, and the loaded ampicillin in MCS nanoparticles could be released with a slow and sustained release profile. Moreover, it was found that pure MCS nanoparticles revealed antibacterial effects, while the delivery of ampicillin from MCS nanoparticles further inhibited bacterial viability. Therefore, the results suggest that MCS nanoparticles are an advanced biomaterial with multiple functions for filling the apical root canal of a tooth due to their unique nanostructure, injectability, apatite-mineralization, osteostimulation, drug-delivery and antibacterial properties.

TI Versatile fabrication of nanoscale sol-gel bioactive glass particles for
   efficient bone tissue regeneration
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB There has been an increased interest in developing nanoscale biomaterials for bone tissue regeneration, due to the biomimetic nano-dimensions and properties compared to natural tissue (bone). Bioactive glass (BG) is regarded as an excellent biomaterial for use in bone regeneration, because of its bioactivity and osteoconductivity. Here, we develop bioactive glass nano-scale particles (NBGs) by sol-gel combining gelation-induced phase separation technology, and demonstrate the effect of bioactive glass dimensions on their physicochemical and biological properties. The micro/nanostructure, surface texture, and bioactive silicon species release were studied to indicate the physicochemical properties of NBGs. The bone-bonding ability was determined by investigating the apatite-forming bioactivity of NBGs. The effect of the micro/nanoscale interface on the attachment and proliferation of human marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) was carried out to determine the biocompatibility of NBGs. All samples showed stable silicone release, and the nanoscale particles (40-800 nm) demonstrated a high apatite-forming ability. The biological results showed that all particle dimensions (40-2000 nm) supported hMSCs attachment and proliferation. The NBG with a nanoscale dimension of 40-180 nm significantly enhanced hMSCs proliferation. This study may provide a new route in the design of bioactive biomaterials' nano-interfaces for efficient bone tissue regeneration.

TI Assessment of the micropore system in wood for drug delivery
SO JOURNAL OF THE AUSTRALIAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB Drug delivery in biomaterials requires consideration of the pore network to store and deliver greater concentrations over an extended period of time. The porous structure in wood is used for delivery of water and therefore presents a possible pore architecture for storing fluids. The goal was to determine the pore characteristics of dried and pyrolysed wood and then investigate the ability to uptake water into the porous network. Balsa (Ochroma Pyramidale Urb) and oak (American: Quercus Alba and European: Quercus Robus) were selected based on the large pore size (100 - 200 mu m). The microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and the pore volume determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry. The open and closed porosity was determined by the Archimedes method. Wood was pyrolyzed in a non-oxiding atmosphere between 800 and 1400 degrees C, the pore structure evaluated and the water uptake determined. Oak provides an open porosity 2.8 times greater than balsa. Pyrolysis of the wood open the pits, connecting vertically oriented tracheids with the other channel systems in wood (vessels and rays) for greater pore interconnectivity. The uptake of water, as determined by a liquid permeability test shows an initial linear uptake of 60% of the total water capacity, followed by a slower uptake of the remaining volume. This study shows that American oak has a larger open porosity and that pore connectivity can be improved by pyrolysis at 800 degrees C. Such a bimodal interconnected pore structure may find use for drug delivery in biomaterials applications.

TI Fundamental Study on Apatite Precipitate Ability of CaO-MgO-SiO2
   Compounders Employed Pseudo Body Solution of Application for
   Biomaterials
SO JOURNAL OF THE AUSTRALIAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB We examined the apatite precipitate ability of CaO-MgO-SiO2 compounders. Synthesized materials were Diopside, Akermanite, Pseudowollastonite, Forsterite and Protoenstatite. Materials were synthesized with solid solution method. Materials soaked to pseudo body solution stirred at 37 degrees C for 1 hour. Diopside, Pseudowollastonite and Protoenstatite precipitated apatite. These materials got precipitation on surface and had the peak of 31-32 degrees by X-ray diffraction patterns. In addition, Diopside, Pseudowollastonite and Protoenstatite eluted less magnesium. These experimental results seem to mean that less magnesium elution can cause more apatite precipitation. However, magnesium consists in vivo and has possibilities to improve biocompatibility. Diopside has ability of elute magnesium and precipitate apatite. In addition, Diopside can make hybrid with titanium. From these results we observed Diopside that could make hybrid with titanium by sol-gel method is appropriate for biomaterials.

TI HEXAVALENT CHROMIUM REDUCTION AND CHROMIUM BIOSORPTION BY Prunus
   serotina BARK
SO FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB The capacity of Prunus serotina bark to remove hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] and total chromium from acidic aqueous solutions was investigated. P. serotina bark exhibited high Cr(VI) removal capacity (93.61 mg g(-1)) as well as total chromium removal capacity (69.93 mg g(-1)). The mechanism of Cr(VI) removal by P. serotina bark implies two simultaneous processes: 1) the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in the presence of P. serotina bark in an aqueous acidic solution, and 2) the biosorption of chromium ions. The kinetic model that satisfactorily described the chromium biosorption process from the Cr(VI) solution was the pseudo second-order model. The experimental results suggest that P. serotina bark biosorbed chromium ions predominantly by a chemical sorption phenomenon. The results of this work underline that P. serotina bark may be used as an effective and low-cost biomaterial for the removal of both Cr(VI) and total chromium from polluted water and wastewater.

TI Insights into Porcelain to Zirconia Bonding
SO JOURNAL OF ADHESION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The application of zirconia, ZrO2, as a biomaterial in medicine started in the early 1980s. Since then, numerous studies have been conducted on this special ceramic material to assess and discover its unique characteristics in practical biomedical applications. Also, zirconia has manifested its extraordinary advantages for use in dental clinical practice since the late 1990s, such as its excellent biocompatibility, good aesthetical appeal and outstanding biomechanical properties. With the development of fabrication methods and more extensive comprehension of this material, zirconia has been employed in more and more dental restorations from single crowns and root canal posts to long-span fixed dentures and, very recently, even as dental implants. However, there are still some drawbacks in its dental applications. Such drawbacks are its relatively weak bonding with porcelain when compared with metal-ceramic system, less reliable bonding with resin-based adhesives, and possible failures caused, e. g., by the effects of low temperature degradation. Although many studies have been carried out on porcelain to zirconia bonding, a thorough understanding of its real mechanism is still far from being achieved. The effects of different treatments before or during the veneering procedure are not clearly elucidated, thus they need further investigations. The aim of this article is to outline the characteristics of zirconia and descriptions of porcelain to zirconia interfacial bonding based on the research conducted in the past few years.

TI Nanostructure controlled anti-cancer drug delivery using
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone) based nanohybrids
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB We have focused on the generation of various nanostructures of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) using surface modified layered silicate. The improved and diverse mechanical, thermal and surface properties have been explored depending upon the nanostructure of the nanohybrids. The incorporation of drug into those nanohybrids further alters the nanostructure and subsequent properties. The rate of biodegradation has been studied in detail, with plausible mechanisms in different enzyme media being suggested, their specificity and the tunability of the biodegradation rate was demonstrated, followed by their optimization. The scaffolds of PCL and its nanohybrids with and without drugs have been prepared through electrospinning to control the dimensions of the nanofibers and their controlled degradation. The in-depth studies of the biocompatibility in terms of cell adhesion, genotoxicity and hemocompatibility have been performed to verify the suitability of the nanohybrids for potential biomedical applications. The biocompatibility of the nanohybrids at the gene level has been tested by the subcellular localization of an important regulator of pro-apoptotic signalling cascade, HIPK2 in human epithelial cells, demonstrating the attuned nature of the particles under study within the biological system. The blood compatibilities of the pure PCL and its nanohybrids were studied by platelet aggregation, platelet adhesion, and in vitro hemolysis assay, elucidating the excellent hemocompatibility of the novel nanohybrids. Biocompatible and hemocompatible nanohybrids have been testified for drug delivery and show sustained and controlled release of anti-cancer drugs (dexamethasone) in the presence of two dimensional disc-like nanoparticles. Hence, the developed nanohybrids are a potential biomaterial, suitable for tissue engineering and drug delivery.

TI Properties and Biocompatibility of Chitosan and Silk Fibroin Blend Films
   for Application in Skin Tissue Engineering
SO SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL
AB Chitosan/silk fibroin (CS/SF) blend films were prepared and evaluated for feasibility of using the films as biomaterial for skin tissue engineering application. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry analysis indicated chemical interaction between chitosan and fibroin. Chitosan enhanced beta-sheet conformation of fibroin and resulted in shifting of thermal degradation of the films. Flexibility, swelling index, and enzyme degradation were also increased by the chitosan content of the blend films. Biocompatibility of the blend films was determined by cultivation with fibroblast cells. All films showed no cytotoxicity by XTT assay. Fibroblast cells spread on CS/SF films via dendritic extensions, and cell-cell interactions were noted. Cell proliferation on CS/SF films was also demonstrated, and their phenotype was examined by the expression of collagen type I gene. These results showed possibility of using the CS/SF films as a supporting material for further study on skin tissue engineering.

SO RSC ADVANCES
AB This study has demonstrated biorefining steps for ryegrass and silage at a pilot scale to extrude fibre cake for the production of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC), a potentially green biomaterial for replacing conventional fillers in the manufacture of polymer composites. Further treatments of processed ryegrass fibres with mechanical shearing, microfluidising, hydrochloric acid (HCl)/sulphuric acid and a four stage {ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid, sodium hydroxide, sodium hypochlorite and HCl} hydrolysis yielded 43.8, 36.1, 25.6 and 39.8 kg t(-1) DM of NFCs respectively. The NFCs were characterised using microscopy, X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, spectroscopy and thermogravimetry. The NFC had diameters from 3.0-9.1 nm and length 308 nm-4.6 mm. NFC-polyvinyl alcohol composites containing NFC (5 wt%) exhibited enhanced Young's modulus and thermal stability by factors of 2.5 and 2 respectively compared with control. The mass, energy, water and chemical balances of the four process steps were assessed to evaluate technical feasibility and also to provide baseline production data for scaling up. The microfluidised product has been identified as the best NFC product, but production cost needs to be reduced.

TI The mechanical properties of amniotic membrane influence its effect as a
   biomaterial for ocular surface repair
SO SOFT MATTER
AB The human amniotic membrane (AM) is a tissue of fetal origin and has proven to be clinically useful as a biomaterial in the management of various ocular surface disorders including corneal stem cell transplantation. However, its success rate displays a degree of clinical unpredictability. We suggest that the measured variability inAMstiffness offers an explanation for the poor clinical reproducibility when it is used as a substrate for stem cell expansion and transplantation. Corneal epithelial stem cells were expanded upon AM samples possessing different mechanical stiffness. To investigate further the importance of biological substrate stiffness on cell phenotype we replaced AM with type I collagen gels of known stiffness. Substrate stiffness was measured using shear rheometry and surface topography was characterized using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The differentiation status of epithelial cells was examined using RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The level of corneal stem cell differentiation was increased in cells expanded upon AM with a high dynamic elastic shear modulus and cell expansion on type I collagen gels confirmed that the level of corneal epithelial stem cell differentiation was related to the substrate's mechanical properties. In this paper we provide evidence to show that the preparatory method of AM for clinical use can affect its mechanical properties and that these measured differences can influence the level of differentiation within expanded corneal epithelial stem cells.

TI Exploring adipogenic differentiation of a single stem cell on
   poly(acrylic acid) and polystyrene micropatterns
SO SOFT MATTER
AB Surface chemistry is an important property of biomaterials and plays a pivotal role in the interaction between stem cells and biomaterials. Comparing the effect of the surface chemistry at the single-cell level should elucidate the mechanism of the interaction. In this study, a micropatterning method was used to investigate the electrostatic effect derived from different chemical groups on the functions of individual human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Differently sized circular micropatterns of negatively charged poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) and neutral polystyrene (PSt) were created using UV photolithography. The PAAc and PSt micropatterns showed different effects on actin cytoskeleton organization and adipogenic differentiation of MSCs. The assembly and distribution of actin filaments for individual MSCs correlated with the degree of cell spreading as well as the surface charge of the underlying substrates. The adipogenic differentiation at the single-cell level was enhanced on the PAAc micropatterns, and decreased as the diameter of the circular micropattern increased. The micropatterning method allows for the construction of diverse micropatterns on various organic substrates with different physicochemical compositions or topographical features, and it enables the analysis of entire cell populations at the single-cell level, significantly facilitating the identification of the optimal surface parameters to manipulate the functions of stem cells.

TI BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE OF BIPHASIC HYDROXYAPATITE/TRICALCIUM PHOSPHATE
   SCAFFOLDS INTENDED FOR LOW LOAD-BEARING ORTHOPAEDIC APPLICATIONS
SO ADVANCED COMPOSITES LETTERS
AB In this study, a calcium phosphate scaffold of hydroxyapatite (HAp) and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) for application in osteoconductive and osteoinductive scaffolds was synthesized and characterized. The important note is that the prepared composites converted to HAp/tricalcium phosphate (TCP) after heat-treatment. This class of composites is interesting because porous HAp/TCP generally degrade more rapid than HAp due to the increased resorption rate of TCP. According to the obtained results, the values of elastic modulus, compressive strength and density of the samples reduced with increasing the percentage of the DCPD phase. It is worth mentioning that the mechanical properties of the prepared samples were near the natural compact bone. The samples were examined in vitro to confirm the apatite forming ability of the composites. Also, in vivo examination in a rabbit model was employed. After fully observation it was concluded that new bone formed on the pore walls, as osteoids and osteoclasts were evident two months postoperatively. Based on the obtained results, the prepared scaffolds seem to be a promising biomaterial for low weight bearing orthopaedic applications.

TI ARSENATE BIOSORPTION BY IRON-MODIFIED PINE SAWDUST IN BATCH SYSTEMS:
   KINETICS AND EQUILIBRIUM STUDIES
SO BIORESOURCES
AB The biosorption of As(V) from aqueous solutions by pine sawdust chemically modified with iron in batch systems was investigated. The loading process of Fe in this biomaterial was achieved by hydrolysis of two different ferric salts. This modification of sawdust is an attempt to improve As(V) biosorption for practical applications. The kinetics and maximum biosorption capacities of the unmodified and modified pine sawdust were evaluated. It was found that the pseudo-second order model described the As(V) biosorption kinetic data and the Langmuir-Freundlich equation described the arsenate sorption equilibrium. These results indicated that the sorption mechanism was chemisorption on a heterogeneous material. The pH effects governing biosorption capacities were also evaluated, showing a decrease as pH value rises, indicating that this biosorption process is highly pH-dependent. The estimated maximum biosorption capacities of As(V), based on the Langmuir-Freundlich fit to the data were, at pH 4, 4.4 mg/g of untreated sawdust, (UN-SW), 12.85 mg/g of ferric chloride modified sawdust (FeCl-SW), and 6 mg/g of ferric nitrate modified sawdust (FeNit-SW); and at pH 7, 2.6 mg/g of UN-SW, 5.9 mg/g of FeCl-SW, and 4.6 mg/g of FeNit-SW. Sorption capacities of iron-modified pine sawdust were evidently higher than other similar biosorbents previously reported.

TI Evaluation of Physical and Biological Properties of Polyvinyl
   Alcohol/Chitosan Blend Films
SO JOURNAL OF MACROMOLECULAR SCIENCE PART B-PHYSICS
AB Polyvinyl alcohol/chitosan (PVA/Cs) blend films with various compositions were prepared using glutaraldehyde (GA) as a crosslinker. The hydrophilicity and swelling behavior of the PVA/Cs films were assessed, and the biological properties of the PVA/Cs films, including cell culture in the extract, cell cytotoxicity, and hemolytic and acute systemic toxicity tests were also investigated. The results showed that all composite films were hydrophilic materials with water contact angles changing from 45.3 +/- 1.1 degrees to 63.2 +/- 1.8 degrees when PVA content was varied from 100 to 0 wt%. The PVA/Cs films showed a significant reduction in swelling behavior as the chitosan content increased. Fibroblasts grown in PVA/Cs extract showed similar appearance with the cells cultured in the negative control medium, and the extract solution of PVA/Cs had no obvious cytotoxic effect. The hemolytic test suggested that the PVA/Cs, with a hemolytic index of 0.91%, did not have an obvious hemolytic reaction. There was no toxicosis or death observed in the acute systemic toxicity test. The results suggest that the complex of PVA and chitosan is a promising candidate biomaterial for tissue engineering.

AB Tissue engineering aims at developing functional substitutes for damaged tissues by mimicking natural tissues. In particular, tissue engineering for bone regeneration enables healing of some bone diseases. Thus, several methods have been developed in order to produce implantable biomaterial structures that imitate the constitution of bone. Electrospinning is one of these methods. This technique produces nonwoven scaffolds made of nanofibers which size and organization match those of the extracellular matrix. Until now, seldom electrospun scaffolds were produced with thickness exceeding one millimeter. This article introduces a new kind of electrospun membrane called 3D scaffold of thickness easily exceeding one centimeter. The manufacturing involves a solution of poly(e-caprolactone) in DMF/DCM system. The aim is to establish parameters for electrospinning in order to characterize these 3D scaffolds and, establish whether such scaffolds are potentially interesting for bone regeneration.

TI Lycopene coupled 'trifoliate' polyaniline nanofibers as multi-functional
   biomaterial
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB Bio-conjugation seems to be an unparalleled avenue to tailor the shape-size-bioactivity accord of nanomaterials. In this backdrop, conjugation of tomato peel lycopene through the green chemistry tool of sonication, under statistically optimized parameters led to the morphological alteration of polyaniline (PAni) nanofiber from linear to biomimetic 'runner' morphology with trifoliate branching as observed under TEM. X-ray diffractogram was suggestive of alterations in the d-spacing and strain in the polymer backbone post lycopene binding. Post bio-conjugation, the semiconducting-behavior of the PAni nanofibers was retained although lycopene coupling resulted in a decrease in the former's conductivity. DMol3 was employed for the quantum molecular calculations of lycopene interacting with PAni (via non-covalent functionalization involving pi-pi stacking) and its solvation study. The contribution to HOMO came from the lycopene unit whereas the LUMO had contribution from the aromatic ring of PAni in the conjugated system. The bioactivity of the PAni nanofibers post bio-conjugation was attested by free radical scavenging and anti-lipid peroxidation of liver tissue homogenate. Epiflorescence microscopic imaging demonstrated the cytocompatibility with L929 normal cell line while the nuclear fragmentation and membrane blebbing of apoptotic HeLa cells vouched for the anticancer action of the conjugated system. Furthermore, the reported system exhibited a stimulatory effect on Cucumis sativus seed germination. Thus the study marshals in support of modulated morphology and desirable bio-action of nanoscaled biomaterials via bio-conjugation for advanced applications.

TI Spheroid Formation and Neural Induction in Human Adipose-Derived Stem
   Cells on a Chitosan-Coated Surface
SO CELLS TISSUES ORGANS
AB The application of stem cells appears to have great therapeutic potential to facilitate nerve regeneration in patients with neurodegenerative disease or spinal cord injury. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs), a subset of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells, possess the great advantages of an abundant amount of cells, less ethical conflict and minimal invasive surgical procedures to obtain the cells. Chitosan, a naturally derived polysaccharide from chitin, has been widely studied to facilitate and guide the direction of nerve regeneration as a biomaterial for the neural tube. Chitosan also serves as a three-dimensional culture substrate to facilitate cellular sphere formation among various cells but is as yet unexplored in hADSCs. In this study, the ability of hADSCs to transdifferentiate from the mesenchymal into the neural lineage by seeding hADSCs on a chitosan-coated surface to form therapeutic cell spheres was investigated. The optimal seeding density (2 x 10(4) cells/cm(2)) and harvesting time (72 h) to obtain sphere formation were determined by cell viability on a chitosan-coated surface. Expression of neural lineage markers was observed by immunofluorescent staining of nestin, neurofilament heavy chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein. The neural induction potentials were also provoked by replating spheres from primary to tertiary passages. The effect of neural induction in hADSCs on a chitosan-coated surface may help to provide cell sources for facilitating nerve regeneration in future clinical applications. Copyright (C) 2012 S.

TI In vitro comparative study of white and dark polycaprolactone
   trifumarate in situ cross-linkable scaffolds seeded with rat bone marrow
   stromal cells
SO CLINICS
AB OBJECTIVE: Dark poly(caprolactone) trifumarate is a successful candidate for use as a bone tissue engineering scaffold. Recently, a white polymeric scaffold was developed that shows a shorter synthesis time and is more convenient for tissue-staining work. This is an in vitro comparative study of both the white and dark scaffolds.
   METHODS: Both white and dark poly(caprolactone) trifumarate macromers were characterized via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy before being chemically cross-linked and molded into disc-shaped scaffolds. Biodegradability was assessed by percentage weight loss on days 7, 14, 28, 42 and 56 (n = 5) after immersion in 10% serum-supplemented medium or distilled water. Static cell seeding was employed in which isolated and characterized rat bone marrow stromal cells were seeded directly onto the scaffold surface. Seeded scaffolds were subjected to a series of biochemical assays and scanning electron microscopy at specified time intervals for up to 28 days of incubation.
   RESULTS: The degradation of the white scaffold was significantly lower compared with the dark scaffold but was within the acceptable time range for bone-healing processes. The deoxyribonucleic acid and collagen contents increased up to day 28 with no significant difference between the two scaffolds, but the glycosaminoglycan content was slightly higher in the white scaffold throughout 14 days of incubation. Scanning electron microscopy at days 1 and 14 revealed cellular growth and attachment.
   CONCLUSIONS: There was no cell growth advantage between the two forms, but the white scaffold had a slower biodegradability rate, suggesting that the newly synthesized poly(caprolactone) trifumarate is more suitable for use as a bone tissue engineering scaffold.

AB In this study, three-dimensional (3D) crosslinked bovine serum albumin (BSA) microstructures containing gold nanorods (AuNRs) at different absorption wavelengths were fabricated via multiphoton excited photochemistry using rose Bengal (RB) as the photoactivator. After the processing, a higher laser power, greater than the threshold of the AuNR photothermal damage at the matched wavelength for the longitudinal plasmon resonance of AuNR, is adopted to reshape the AuNRs into gold nanospheres at the designed positions of the 3D structure. As a result, 3D BSA microstructures containing different color AuNRs at the designed positions can be successfully fabricated. The AuNRs-doped BSA multicolor microstructures not only can be applied in biomedical scaffolds with plasmonic properties such as two-photon luminescence imaging and photothermal therapy but also can be a specific 3D biomaterial microdevice for plasmonic field.

TI Adsorption of Mixtures of Toxic Metal Ions Using Non-viable Cells of
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae
SO ADSORPTION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The use of waste biomaterial for the adsorption of heavy metal ions is an economically appealing alternative to conventional metal ion removal methods. In the present work, S. cerevisiae biomass has been shown to be capable of the simultaneous removal of more than 98% of Pb(II) ions, 60% of Zn(II) ions and up to 55% of Cu(II) ions from aqueous solutions in the 10-50 mg/l concentration range. Model equations describing the removal efficiency of each metal ion were determined using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with respect to operating conditions such as pH, initial metal ion concentration and biomass dosage. Characterization of the metal ion-biomass interactions responsible for biosorption was studied employing zeta potential measurements, BET, FT-IR and EDX techniques; these indicated that the uptake of metal ions by non-living yeast was a surface adsorption phenomenon. The results proved the involvement of an ion-exchange mechanism between the adsorbing metal ions and the cell walls. In the presence of the complete range of metal ions studied, yeast cells were more selective towards Pb(II) ions.

TI Prospects of Tendon Tissue Engineering in Sports Medicine
SO DEUTSCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SPORTMEDIZIN
AB The prevalence of tendon injury has been rising due, in part. to increased participation in recreational and competitive sports. Primary surgical repair still represents the gold standard in the treatment of these injuries. However, graft transplantation in scenarios that involve tissue loss still presents clinical challenges. While many biomaterial grafts have historically been used in tendon reconstruction and most have since fallen out of favor, advances in tissue engineering and fibrous scaffold fabrication have made the use of engineered grafts closer than ever to clinical translatability. Stem cells and biomaterials play a prominent role in tissue engineering as they provide the biological units and the scaffolding, respectively, to support the regeneration of the proper tendon structure, which is also guided by growth factors and signals that regulate wound healing or the development of the tissue during embryogenesis. In this review, we examine a biomimetic approach to engineer a tendon replacement that takes into account the mesenchymal origins of the tendon progenitors, factors that influence the differentiation of these cells within the framework of developmental biology of tendon, and scaffold fabrication technologies that have the potential to replicate the structure of the fibrous matrix in the design of the biomaterial scaffold. In doing so, the review presents current concepts and advances, and emerging evidence of paradigm shifts and technological breakthrough that will predictably be the subject of future research.

AB Medium thickness transparent layers are becoming increasingly important in various fields of materials science such as in micro-electronics, nanotechnologies, polymer science, biomaterials and chemistry. Such layers vary from simple, transparent layers to those that are much more complex, containing heterogeneous materials and very rough interfaces and requiring new types of characterization techniques. In this paper we present the application of white light scanning interferometry to the structural tomography of such layers. Due to the complexity of the fringe signals along the optical axis, we have developed 2D signal processing techniques of the XZ images to improve the robustness to noise. Knowing that the measurements are prone to artifacts we have also developed a cautious approach to the extraction of pertinent information. Thus, using a manual point Z-scan investigation in an XY image, initial information of the quality of the fringe signals and the appropriate signal processing necessary can be obtained and provide initial structural information. Then, optimized image processing can be performed on the XZ images to provide tomographic cross sections of the layer. Applications of the technique are given on transparent and insulating layers used in electronics and microelectronics, layers of hydroxyapatite (a biomaterial) and colloidal layers.

TI Osteogenic capacity of nanocrystalline bone cement in a weight-bearing
   defect at the ovine tibial metaphysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE
AB The synthetic material Nanobone (R) (hydroxyapatite nanocrystallines embedded in a porous silica gel matrix) was examined in vivo using a standardized bone defect model in the ovine tibial metaphysis. A standardized 6 x 12 x 24-mm bone defect was created below the articular surface of the medial tibia condyles on both hind legs of 18 adult sheep. The defect on the right side was filled with Nanobone (R), while the defect on the contralateral side was left empty. The tibial heads of six sheep were analyzed after 6, 12, and 26 weeks each. The histological and radiological analysis of the defect on the control side did not reveal any bone formation after the total of 26 weeks. In contrast, the microcomputed tomography analysis of the defect filled with Nanobone (R) showed a 55%, 72%, and 74% volume fraction of structures with bone density after 6, 12, and 26 weeks, respectively. Quantitative histomorphological analysis after 6, and 12 weeks revealed an osteoneogenesis of 22%, and 36%, respectively. Hematoxylin and eosin sections demonstrated multinucleated giant cells on the surface of the biomaterial and resorption lacunae, indicating osteoclastic resorptive activity. Nanobone (R) appears to be a highly potent bone substitute material with osteoconductive properties in a loaded large animal defect model, supporting the potential use of Nanobone (R) also in humans.

TI Organic-inorganic nanocomposite gels as an in situ gelation biomaterial
   for injectable accommodative intraocular lens
SO SOFT MATTER
AB We focus on the development of a novel injectable accommodative lens for intraocular applications, which is based on a thermosensitive hydrophobically modified poly(ethylene glycol) (HM-PEG) containing hydrophilized silica nanoparticles. We distinguished macroscopically, with changes in the temperature or concentration, two regions in the phase diagram for aqueous solution of HM-PEG: transparent sol and transparent gel. These changes occurred reversibly, without hysteresis, when the temperature was decreased. The temperature and concentration regime in which the gel formed are reduced by adding silica nanoparticles into the gel matrix. Small-angle neutron scattering measurements for nanocomposite gels provide good proof of a gel phase where the high shear-modulus is gained by a high inter-micellar correlation originating in the crystalline order. Under the condition of uniform distribution of silica nanoparticles with small size (2-5 nm) in the gel matrix, an increase in the refractive index up to 0.0667 was obtained for the nanocomposite gel compared with the native gel matrix without an increase in turbidity. This composite system could be formulated to match the modulus and the refractive index of the natural lens (similar to 1.411), and was easily extruded through a narrow-gauge needle. Rapid endocapsular gelation yielded an optically clear gel within the lens capsular bag. This technique enables us to validate methods to determine the biomechanics of the lens and its role in accommodation. The modification of the mechanical response and stability of the HM-PEG network by addition of silica nanoparticles was also investigated in detail.

Based on the demonstrated ability for scaffold surfaces to dramatically influence cell viability and adhesion, in this study we characterize hDSC viability, affinity, and differentiation on 3D scaffolds. Isolated human tooth cells were obtained from patients scheduled extraction (CONEP-13083) and plated and expanded in standard tissue culture conditions. After 20 and 30 days, hDSCs were observed under inverted microscopy, followed by TEM and SEM analyses, which revealed the activity of hDSCs on each scaffold type, including cells adhesion on the biomaterial surface. The high cells activity was observed where we found more mitochondria and rugous endoplasmatic reticulum representing high energy and mRNA production for cells proliferation in similarity with the control group. The PGA and PHB exhibited the better hDSCs adhesion with 3D scaffold interface.

AB Silk Fibroin (SF) protein, which is derived from the cocoons of the Bombyx Mori silkworms, has been used widely for biomedical applications, such as surgical sutures, owning to its high mechanical strength and biocompatibility. Recent advances in the Tissue Engineering (TE) field have acknowledged and recognized SF as a feasible candidate for tissue repair and regeneration; the regenerated form of SF protein in sponge networks has demonstrated potential for both soft and hard tissue replacements. However, adequate cell growth within the SF foams remained as a challenge to TE. Thus, in the present study, novel SF scaffolds with macro-channels were fabricated using the Additive Manufacturing (AM) or Rapid Prototyping (RP) technology. This work is, to our knowledge, the first generation of SF tissue constructs with both micro- and macro-scaled structures. The SF scaffolds were formed by casting aqueous SF solution to negative moulds made from a 3D inkjet printer. In vitro examinations of the scaffold specimens revealed that the indirect approach does not induce toxicity and were able to maintain the intrinsic properties of the naturally-derived biomaterial.

AB In this paper, a bio-inspired scaffold design has been proposed by incorporating its functional (biological requirement) and fabrication constraint into the design processes. The proposed new methodology generates functionally gradient porosity along the hollowed scaffold architecture with desired level of control by combining two geometrically oriented consecutive layers. The resulting set of layers address the repeatable, interconnected and controllable pores. Modeling of the first layer starts with discretizing internal region by connecting ruling lines between internal and external features using a dynamic programming algorithm. These feature connecting ruling lines act as resolution for the proposed method. Then by accumulating those ruling lines, the region has been divided into equal area sub-regions. In the second layer, the desired pore size and hence the porosity has been achieved by geometrically partitioning those sub-regions. And thus the combined set of layers achieves the desired controlled variational porosity along the scaffold architecture. To ensure a continuous and interconnected tool path, optimized zigzag pattern followed by a concentric spiral like optimal layers are generated based on the required biological and mechanical properties. Several examples will be presented to demonstrate the proposed methodology. The designed examples will also be fabricated layer-by-layer using a micro-nozzle biomaterial deposition system.

AB This study evaluated the rheological behavior of poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) with two thermal initiators for used in rapid protoyping (RP). The PVA has excellent biocompatible and lubrication properties, it is a versatile biomaterial which presents studies for the use in the treatment, replacement of cartilage and also as scaffold. The PVA is crosslinked to have different mechanical, chemical and physical properties. The RP technology has been used and studied in medical field to production of customized medical devices for each patient, and to production of biomodels for surgical plans. RP manufacturing technique allows the production of products with high precision and a very fast production. The rheological study was made to determine the optimal parameters for chemical crosslinking using the (PVA) aqueous solution in presence of potassium persulfate (KPS) and 4,4 - Azobis (4 - Cyanovaleric acid) (Azobis) as thermo initiators.

TI Fretting behaviour of 316L stainless steel produced by powder injection
   moulding
SO KOVOVE MATERIALY-METALLIC MATERIALS
AB The biocompatible metals made available for powder injection moulding (PIM) are increasing, and as a result, the PIM process is becoming attractive for manufacturers of medical implants and surgical instruments. In addition, friction and wear properties play an important role in biomaterial applications. This study aimed to systematically investigate the fretting wear properties of 316L stainless steel parts produced by PIM under dry contact conditions. The fretting experiments were performed under gross-slip regime. The influence of a number of fretting test parameters on the friction and wear behaviour was investigated, as the contact frequency, the normal load, and number of reciprocating sliding cycles. Fretting tests were performed against corundum counter bodies. After the tests, the wear scars were examined by laser surface profilometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis. The results indicate that wear occurred predominantly by abrasion, plastic deformation, and cracking.

TI Ion electrodiffusion governs silk electrogelation
SO SOFT MATTER
AB Silk electrogelation involves the transition of an aqueous silk fibroin solution to a gel state (E-gel) in the presence of an electric current. The process is based on local pH changes as a result of water electrolysis - generating H+ and OH- ions at the (+) and (-) electrodes, respectively. Silk fibroin has a pI = 4.2 and when local pH < pI, E-gel forms. An experimental system was constructed that allowed the measurement of E-gel growth and pH distribution for an applied current. To explain the observed rectangular pH profile of pH(gel) approximate to 4 surrounded by pH(silk-solution) approximate to 10, a finite-element ion electrodiffusion model was developed. The model relies on electrodiffusion of the generated H+ and OH- ions. Initially, inputs into the model were the measured E-gel and voltage curves. The governing ion electrodiffusion equations were solved and the calculated pH matched the experimental pH profile, indicating that ion electrodiffusion dictates local pH changes and E-gel growth. Furthermore, the model predicted the constant currents (2 mA and 3 mA) necessary for two hypothetical E-gel growth curves and these results were then validated experimentally. The model thus shows how ion electrodiffusion governs the electrogelation process and also provides predictable outcomes for fundamental and practical E-gel applications.

AB Polymer implants are interesting alternatives to the contemporary load-bearing implants made from metals. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK), a well-established biomaterial for example, is not only iso-elastic to bone but also permits investigating the surrounding soft tissues using magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, which is particularly important for cancer patients. The commercially available PEEK bone implants, however, require costly coatings, which restricts their usage. As an alternative to coatings, plasma activation can be applied. The present paper shows the plasma-induced preparation of nanostructures on polymer films and on injection-molded micro-cantilever arrays and the associated chemical modifications of the surface. In vitro cell experiments indicate the suitability of the activation process. In addition, we show that microstructures such as micro-grooves 1 mu m deep and 20 mu m wide cause cell alignment. The combination of micro-injection molding, simultaneous microstructuring using inserts/bioreplica and plasma treatments permits the preparation of polymer implants with nature-analogue, anisotropic micro-and nanostructures.

TI Matrix-Assisted Pulsed Laser Thin Film Deposition by Using Nd:YAG Laser
SO JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS
AB Matrix-Assisted Pulsed Laser Evaporation (MAPLE) is a deposition technique, developed from Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) especially well suited for producing organic/polymeric thin films, which can take advantage from using Nd:YAG laser. Depending on the relative values of light absorption coefficients of the solvent and of the molecules to be deposited, laser energy is directly absorbed by the solvent or is transferred to it, providing a softer desorption mechanism with respect to PLD. In PLD ultraviolet laser radiation is commonly used, but in MAPLE, since easily damaged molecules are usually involved, the use of Nd: YAG laser offers the advantage to allow selecting laser wavelength from ultraviolet (266 nm or 355 nm, corresponding to 4.66 eV or 3.49 eV photon energies, resp.) to visible (532 nm, 2.33 eV) to infrared (1064 nm, 1.17 eV). In this paper, the MAPLE technique is described in details, together with a survey of current and possible future applications for both organic and biomaterial deposition taking into account the advantages of using an Nd: YAG laser. Beside other results, we have experimental confirmation that MAPLE applications are not limited to transparent molecules highly soluble in light absorbing solvent, thus allowing deposition of poorly soluble light absorbing molecules suspended in a light transparent liquid.

TI Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP), an Attractive Substrate for Retinal
   Implant
SO SENSORS AND MATERIALS
AB Recently, there has been growing interest in liquid crystal polymer (LCP) as a new biomaterial for next-generation implantable neural prosthetic devices. LCP has a very low moisture absorption rate compared with other polymers such as polyimide or parylene-C, providing a superior long-term reliability in the human body. In addition, LCP film is compatible with semiconductor processes, and layer-to-layer lamination is possible simply by fusion bonding of multiple LCP sheets with heat and pressure without the use of adhesives. A monolithic system can be implemented by using LCP as the substrate of electrodes and printed circuit boards as well as packaging material. Therefore, the LCP-based system can achieve a much higher long-term reliability, while maintaining the merits of conventional polymer-based systems such as thinness, flexibility, and simple fabrication procedure. In the present study, we have shown the feasibility of LCP as a substrate and packaging material for a novel monolithic retinal prosthetic device. The patterns of printed circuits and a planar coil were formed on LCP films by thin-film processes, and eye-surface-conformable structure was achieved that enables the attachment of the whole retinal implant on the eyeball. It has been verified that the spherical deformation process did not adversely affect the electrical characteristics or the performance of the printed circuits and the planar coil. The long-term reliability of LCP-encapsulation was evaluated by an in vitro accelerated soak test, and possible failure mechanisms were investigated. The LCP-encapsulation could provide reliable electrical insulation for similar to 400 days in 75 degrees C phosphate-buffered solution (PBS).

TI Composites of Hydroxyapatite Whiskers/poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) with
   High Tensile Plasticity
SO JOURNAL OF MACROMOLECULAR SCIENCE PART B-PHYSICS
AB Hydroxyapatite whiskers (HAW) with a maximum aspect ratio of 20 were employed to improve the toughness of poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (AMEO) was grafted on the surface of the hydroxyapatite whiskers (g-HAW) to improve its wetting in the PLGA matrix. Composites based on HAW, g-HAW, and PLGA were prepared. The structure and properties of the composites were subsequently investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and tensile testing. The g-HAW were distributed homogenously in the PLGA matrix because of improved wetting of g-HAW while the HAW were aggregated. The stronger interfacial bonding also gave rise to improved mechanical properties of the g-HAW/PLGA composites. The HAW/PLGA and g-HAW/PLGA composites failed in a tough manner with intensive plastic deformation. The g-HAW/PLGA composite (5 wt% g-HAW) failed at a maximum elongation of 366%, although the tensile strength dropped slightly. The g-HAW/PLGA composite (1 wt% g-HAW) maintained the initial tensile strength of neat PLGA but failed at an equally high elongation of 347%, whereas PLGA failed at an elongation of 11%.

TI Fabrication, characterisation and performance of hydrophilic and
   super-hydrophilic silica as cell culture surfaces
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB We demonstrate a straightforward procedure for the controlled formation of silica films on tissue culture polystyrene (PS) surfaces. The films were formed by sequentially treating PS with polyaniline, glutaric dialdehyde and protein prior to silica formation. The films could be tailored to exhibit super-hydrophilicity (contact angle < 5 degrees) which was retained for more than two months under ambient conditions. Both hydrophilic and super-hydrophilic silica coated surfaces were suitable for the culture of an adherent human melanoma cell line. Proliferation, toxicity and adhesion assays were used to compare cell behaviour. Cells on the silica surfaces showed enhanced adhesion and comparable rates of cell proliferation as compared to cells grown on conventional tissue culture plastic. The results obtained can be understood by considering the surface properties of the different materials and the ability of the silica coated surfaces to adsorb significantly higher levels of serum proteins from the growth medium. One of the outcomes of this study is a re-evaluation of the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity characteristics required for good cell growth and the possibility of designing new tissue culture materials capable of greater control over cell populations.

TI Phosphatase responsive peptide surfaces
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB The development of interactive surfaces able to respond to biological cues is of interest for the development of next generation biomaterials. We report the design, synthesis and characterisation of an enzyme responsive peptide based surface whose chemical properties change upon catalytic action of alkaline phosphatase (AP). AP is a membrane-anchored enzyme involved in osteogenesis (bone formation), making it a suitable biomolecule to facilitate interactivity between the cell and the biomaterial surface. Surface analysis is used to follow dephosphorylation and a phosphate assay is used to determine the amount of phosphate removed by the enzyme. This analysis reveals significant differences in the dephosphorylation rate at the surface compared to that in solution. The ability of the surface to respond to native enzymes expressed by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was indirectly explored by assessing the response of the cells to phosphorylated, non-phosphorylated and enzymatically dephosphorylated surfaces. No differences were found between the surfaces, suggesting that cell expressed enzymes are able to dephosphorylate the peptide surfaces rapidly. This work presents the first phosphatase responsive surfaces whose phosphorylation state can be altered by native enzymes provided by the cells.

TI Maxillary sinus floor augmentation using a nano-crystalline
   hydroxyapatite silica gel: Case series and 3-month preliminary
   histological results
SO ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER
AB The aim of this case series is to histologically examine a new hydroxyapatite in sinus lift procedure after 3 months. Ten 2-stage sinus lifts were performed in 10 healthy patients having initial bone height of 1-2 mm and bone width of 5 mm, asking for a fixed implant-supported rehabilitation. After graft material augmentation, a rough-surfaced mini-implant was inserted to maintain stability of the sinus widow. A bioptical core containing a mini-implant was retrieved 3 months after maxillary sinus augmentation with NanoBone (R) and processed for undecalcified histology. From the histomorphometric analysis, NanoBone (R) residuals accounted for the 38.26%+/- 8.07% of the bioptical volume, marrow spaces for the 29.23%+/- 5.18% and bone for the 32.51%+/- 4.96% (new bone: 20.64%+/- 2.96%, native bone: 11.87%+/- 3.27%). Well-mineralized regenerated bone with lamellar parallel-fibred structure and Haversian systems surrounded the residual NanoBone (R) particles. The measured bone-to-implant contact amounted to 26.02%+/- 5.46%. No connective tissue was observed at the implant boundary surface. In conclusion, the tested material showed good histological outcomes also 3 months after surgery. In such critical conditions, the use of a rough-surfaced mini-implant showed BIC values supposed to be effective also in case of functional loading. Although longer follow-up and a wider patient size are needed, these preliminary results encourage further research on this biomaterial for implant load also under early stage and critical conditions.

SO ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER
AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of BONITmatrix (R) and OSSA NOVA on the expression of growth factors and osteogenic differentiation. For this purpose, the mRNA expression of VEGF, IGF1, IGF2, collagen-1, collagen-2 and MMP8 was analysed in surgically created defects on the crania of adult male rats. Cranial samples were collected after implantation of BONITmatrix (R) or OSSA NOVA scaffolds for 4 weeks and determinations of gene expression were performed by quantitative RT-PCR. Real-time RT-PCR analyses showed a significantly higher expression of IGF1 in both groups treated with BONITmatrix (R) and OSSA NOVA compared to untreated controls, whereas type I collagen mRNA expression only increased in BONITmatrix (R) treated rats compared to controls. No changes in transcript expression of IGF2, VEGF, collagen-2 and MMP8 were detectable between the analysed groups. In conclusion, BONITmatrix (R) and OSSA NOVA stimulate the expression of growth factor IGF1, but only the granular dosage form is able to stimulate osteoblast differentiation. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

TI Hydroxyapatite/platinum bio-photocatalyst: a biomaterial approach to
   self-cleaning
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB A bio-inspired approach to photocatalysis with a selection of biologically acceptable building blocks that can be activated by non-toxic visible light is a direction of research for the design of advanced, biomaterials that are able to induce self-cleaning. Here we show that a combination of hydroxyapatite (HAp) with platinum (Pt-0 and Ptn+) is suitable to form a novel photocatalytically active material. The so-formed hybrid semiconductor/metallic nanocomposites made of apatite plates with Pt metallic nanoparticles attached to their surface and two different types of surface-adsorbed Pt-complexes are an innovative solution for the design of functional bioactive materials. This material can be activated by exposure to either ultraviolet (UV) or visible (Vis) light. UV activation is allowed by the semiconductor HAp phase, while the activity induced by Vis light is related to complexes adsorbed onto the HAp surface. Pt metallic nanoparticles have the ability to trap electrons, which provides an extension of the material's activity during the period when it is kept in the dark.

TI Design and synthesis of three-dimensional hydrogel scaffolds for
   intervertebral disc repair
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB Intervertebral disc degeneration is a major cause of low back pain, which affects a large proportion of the population. Spinal fusion is one of the common solutions to restrict motion and stabilize, however biomechanical changes cause further problems. Although tissue engineered IVD structures and cell based therapies are being developed it is crucial that the structures are able to support spinal load. In this paper we report a biomaterial based regenerative approach with the first stage being the synthesis and characterisation of a group of hydrogels that has the potential to be further developed for cell-biomaterial based approaches. Copolymers of 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate and a multifunctional comonomer, pyromellitic glycerol dimethacrylate p(HEMA/PMGDM) were synthesized and the effects of composition on the thermal behaviour and dynamic mechanical behaviour of these copolymeric hydrogels and the feasibility of use as biomaterials for IVD are reported. The HEMA-co-PMGDM copolymeric networks were shown to have highly controllable viscoelastic properties; the presence of a strong beta transition in the glassy region (in vivo temperature range) and the energy absorption and dissipation of the system (critical to disc function) could be easily controlled by tailoring the copolymer composition, crosslinking agent concentration and polymerisation methods, which is of great significance for the end use of these materials, as the essential function of the gelatinous nucleus is to resist, dampen and redistribute mechanical forces within the spine outwards towards the constricting annulus. To date there is no previous research incorporating PMGDM into hydrogel systems for biomedical applications.

   of individual micro-/nanoorganisms
SO LAB ON A CHIP
AB A review of present and future on-chip rolled-up devices, which can be used to develop lab-in-a-tube total analysis systems, is presented. Lab-in-a-tube is the integration of numerous rolled-up components into a single device constituting a microsystem of hundreds/thousands of independent units on a chip, each individually capable of sorting, detecting and analyzing singular organisms. Such a system allows for a scale-down of biosensing systems, while at the same time increasing the data collection through a large, smart array of individual biosensors. A close look at these ultracompact components which have been developed over the past decade is given. Methods for the capture of biomaterial are laid out and progress of cell culturing in three-dimensional scaffolding is detailed. Rolled-up optical sensors based on photoluminescence, optomechanics, optofluidics and metamaterials are presented. Magnetic sensors are introduced as well as electrical components including heating, energy storage and resistor devices.

TI Microrheology of biomaterial hydrogelators
SO SOFT MATTER
AB Microrheology uses the motion of dispersed colloidal probe particles to measure the viscosity or viscoelastic moduli of soft materials. The distinct advantages of microrheology include small sample volume requirements, access to a large range of time scales for the dynamic response and short acquisition times. These advantages make microrheology important for studies of biomaterial hydrogelators. Recent advances have enabled the precise characterization of hydrogelator sol-gel transitions, measurements of rare and scarce materials and high-throughput screening of hydrogel rheology over a large composition space. In this review, we focus on multiple particle tracking microrheology, including the considerations that define its operating regimes and its recent applications. Those interested in biomaterial rheology will find these methods as accessible as bulk rheological measurements and straightforward to implement in their own work.

TI Unexpected beta-sheets and molecular orientation in flagelliform spider
   silk as revealed by Raman spectromicroscopy
SO SOFT MATTER
AB Structural data relative to spider silk fibers such as the flagelliform (Flag) silk are fundamental to understand the origin of their outstanding mechanical properties. However, due to its small diameter and limited availability, experimental data relative to the structure of the Flag silk are almost nonexistent. Raman spectromicroscopy is one of the rare techniques that can provide structural information about this type of silk. We have thus used this technique to characterize Flag silk fibers spun by three orb-weaving spiders in their native state. The polarized spectra reveal that Flag fibers spun by Araneus diadematus and Argiope aurantia spiders unexpectedly contain beta-sheets and exhibit a certain level of molecular orientation. In contrast, the Flag silk from Nephila clavipes possesses very few beta-sheets and a low molecular orientation, the proteins being essentially disordered. These observations account for the higher strength and lower extensibility of Araneus diadematus and Argiope aurantia Flag fibers compared with Nephila clavipes. The analysis of the primary structure strongly suggests that the "spacer" motifs of the Flag silk are more prominent and have a higher beta-sheet propensity for spider species that spin fibers containing beta-sheets. These results nicely support the Raman data and provide the first hypothesis regarding the role played by these spacers in the structure of Flag silk. The structural data obtained provide a molecular basis for the tensile properties of these fibers showing that overall, considering the different types of spider silk, the beta-sheet appears to be a universal structural element used by nature to provide strength to fibers that exhibit dissimilar tensile properties.

TI Delivery of Growth Factors for Tissue Regeneration and Wound Healing
SO BIODRUGS
AB Growth factors are soluble secreted proteins capable of affecting a variety of cellular processes important for tissue regeneration. Consequently, the self-healing capacity of patients can be augmented by artificially enhancing one or more processes important for healing through the application of growth factors. However, their application in clinics remains limited due to lack of robust delivery systems and biomaterial carriers. Interestingly, all clinically approved therapies involving growth factors utilize some sort of a biomaterial carrier for growth factor delivery. This suggests that biomaterial delivery systems are extremely important for successful usage of growth factors in regenerative medicine. This review outlines the role of growth factors in tissue regeneration, and their application in both pre-clinical animal models of regeneration and clinical trials is discussed. Additionally, current status of biomaterial substrates and sophisticated delivery systems such as nanoparticles for delivery of exogenous growth factors and peptides in humans are reviewed. Finally, issues and possible future research directions for growth factor therapy in regenerative medicine are discussed.

TI Polymer Composite-A Potential Biomaterial for the Removal of Reactive
   Dye
SO E-JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Poly Pyrrle saw dust composite was prepared by reinforcement of natural wood saw dust (obtained from Euphorbia Tirucalli L wood) and Poly Pyrrole matrix phase. The present study investigates the adsorption behaviour of Poly Pyrrole Saw dust Composite towards reactive dye. The batch adsorption studies were carried out by varying solution pH, initial dye concentration, contact time and temperature. The kinetic study showed that adsorption of Reactive Red by PPC was best represented by pseudo-second order kinetics with ion exchange adsorption. The equilibrium data were analyzed by Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm model. The equilibrium isotherm data were fitted well with Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacities calculated by Langmuir model were 204.08 mg/g for Reactive Red at 303 K. The thermodynamic parameters suggest the spontaneous, endothermic nature of ion exchange adsorption with weak Vader walls force of attraction. Activation energy for the adsorption of Reactive by Poly Pyrrole Composite was 11.6387 kJ/mole, Isosteric Heat of adsorption was 48.5454 kJ/mole also supported the ion exchange adsorption process in which forces of attraction between dye molecules and PPC is weak.

AB The amylose component of starch can form complexes known as V-amylose with amphiphilic or hydrophobic ligands. The V-amylose complexes are single, left-handed helices that are arranged as crystalline and amorphous lamellae, which may form distinct nano- or micron-scale structures. V-amylose has potential as a biomaterial for nanoencapsulation of sensitive bioactive and flavor ingredients, modification of rheological behavior of starch-containing products, reduction of starch retrogradation, and postprandial hyperglycaemia in diabetics. Various aspects of V-amylose structure, methods of preparation, factors that affect its formation, and the significance and potential applications of the V-amylose complexes are reviewed.

TI Designing dynamic surfaces for regulation of biological responses
SO SOFT MATTER
AB ABA block copolymers composed of highly methylated polyrotaxane and hydrophobic anchoring terminal segments containing 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and n-butyl methacrylate (PMB) (OMe-PRX-PMB) were synthesized as a platform of molecularly dynamic biomaterials. A contact angle measurement indicated that polymer surfaces with higher molecular mobility factors (M-f) estimated from quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) measurements showed more significant changes in hydrophilicity in response to an environmental change between air and water; the OMe-PRX-PMB surface showed the highest M-f among the prepared polymer surfaces. Fibrinogen adsorption and its conformational analysis estimated by QCM-D and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that large amounts of fibrinogen adsorption occurred in a soft manner on the OMe-PRX-PMB surface and that the antibody binding to the C-terminus of the fibrinogen gamma chains responsible for platelet adhesion and activation decreased as the M-f value increased. Furthermore, it was found that the OMe-PRX-PMB surface showed low platelet adhesion and high fibroblast adhesion, suggesting that molecular movement on biomaterial surfaces could be one of the key parameters in the regulation of a non-specific biological response.

TI Encapsulation by Janus spheroids
SO SOFT MATTER
AB Micro/nano encapsulation technology has acquired considerable attention in the fields of drug delivery, biomaterial engineering, and materials science. Based on recent advances in chemical particle synthesis, we propose a primitive model of an encapsulation system produced by the self-assembly of Janus oblate spheroids, particles with oblate spheroidal bodies and two hemi-surfaces coded with dissimilar chemical properties. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate the encapsulation system with spherical particles as encapsulated guests, for different densities. We study the anisotropic effect due to the encapsulating agent's geometric shape and chemical composition on the encapsulation morphology and efficiency. Given the relatively high encapsulation efficiency we find from the simulations, we believe that this method of encapsulation has potential practical value.

TI Effect of Poly(L-lactic acid) on Hydrolytic Degradation of Poly(glycolic

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLYMERIC MATERIALS
AB The in-vitro degradation behavior of poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) rods and the composite rods containing poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) were investigated via mass loss, pH value change, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Since the degradation rate of PLLA is lower than that of PGA, PLLA/PGA composite rods exhibit a slower degradation rate in comparison with PGA. This finding indicated that it was possible to control the degradation rate of the composites by changing their composition. This result indicates that this kind of composite biomaterial may be applicable to devices for the need of prolonged degradation.

The chemical structures of LCSOs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that LCSOs had two phase transitions during heating. Thermoplastic chitosan oligosaccharide (LCSO-4) has distinct melting temperature (T-m) at 64 degrees C and 110 degrees C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses indicated that the crystal structure of CSO was changed through acylation and had created new crystal domains of lauroyl side chains. New strong diffraction peaks were observed around 2 theta values of 20.0 degrees, 21.5 degrees and 26.3 degrees for thermoplastic acylated chitosan oligosaccharide (LCSO-4). The melting and crystallization properties of thermoplastic acylated chitosan oligosaccharide were observed by polarized optical microscope (POM).

The experiments were carried out on biomaterial dryer using the combined solar energy and heat rejected from a split-type air conditioner. The effectiveness was evaluated based on the comparison of various drying methods, in terms of drying kinetics of the biomaterial being dried, under Thailand's climate conditions. The banana was chosen as testing materials. The banana was dried by the dryer with using three drying methods: Heat rejected from an air conditioner; solar energy; and the combined solar energy and heat rejected from an air conditioner. The result shows that the combined solar energy and heat rejected for drying biomaterials were found to have a shorter drying time, higher energy efficiency, and more natural appearance of dried biomaterial compared to the conventional drying method.

TI Diabetes Mellitus Affects Biomechanical Properties of the Optic Nerve
   Head in the Rat
SO OPHTHALMIC RESEARCH
AB Background: To investigate the effect of diabetes on the biomechanical behavior of the optic nerve head (ONH) and the peripapillary sclera (ppSc) in streptozocine-induced diabetic rats. Methods: Diabetes mellitus was induced in 20 Wistar rats using streptozocine. Twenty-five nondiabetic rats served as controls. Eyes were enucleated after 12 weeks and 2 strips of one eye were prepared containing ONH or ppSc. The stress-strain relation was measured in the stress range of 0.05-10 MPa using a biomaterial tester. Results: At 5% strain the stress of the ONH in diabetic rats was 897 +/- 295 kPa and in the control group it was 671 +/- 246 kPa; there was a significant difference between both groups (p = 0.011). The stress of the diabetic ppSc (574 +/- 185 kPa) increased compared to that of the nondiabetic ppSc (477 +/- 171 kPa), but this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.174). The calculated tangent modulus at 5% strain was 11.79 MPa in the diabetic ONH and 8.77 MPa in the nondiabetic ONH; there was a significant difference between both groups (p = 0.006). The calculated tangent modulus at 5% strain was 7.17 MPa in the diabetic ppSc and 6.12 MPa in the nondiabetic ppSc, without a statistically significant difference (p = 0.09). Conclusion: In contrast to the ppSc, the ONH of diabetic rats showed a significant increase in stiffness compared to nondiabetic rats, which might be explained by nonenzymatic collagen cross-linking mediated by advanced glycation end products due to high blood glucose levels in diabetes. Further studies are needed to investigate if these biomechanical changes represent a detrimental risk factor for intraocular pressure regulation in diabetic glaucoma patients. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

AB Dicarboxylic anhydride esterified Konjac glucomannan (DCKGM) was prepared to reduce the unusual water absorbency of native Konjac Glucomannan (KGM). The dependence of degree of substitution (DS) on the reaction conditions and influence of the DS on water absorbency were studied. The esterification was conducted using refluxing KGM in hot acetic acid which contains phthalic anhydride and pyridine catalyst. The chemical structure and characteristic of DCKGM were analyzed by GPC-MALLS and FI-IR. The results showed that the water absorbency for DCKGM is inversely proportional to DS increase. DCKGM may be a promising biomaterial in application of drug carrier, heavy metal ion adsorption and functional packing materials.

AB Photonic crystal surfaces that can be fabricated inexpensively over large surface areas can be designed to produce optical resonances for any desired wavelength in the optical spectrum from ultraviolet to infrared. Label-free biosensing is obtained by measuring shifts in the resonant wavelength as biomaterial deposits on the photonic crystal, while the intensified electric fields that occur due to coupling of illumination at the resonant wavelength may be used to more effectively excite fluorescence or Raman scattering. Photon emitters, such as quantum dots, fluorescent dye molecules, and Raman scatters can efficiently couple their energy to detection instruments when they are in close proximity to a photonic crystal with a resonance that matches the emission wavelength. Finally, the narrowband optical filtering capability of photonic crystals can be effectively applied for infrared absorption imaging of biological specimens at discrete wavelengths. This talk will summarize recent activities in the Nano Sensors Group at the University of Illinois in which photonic crystals are used to address a variety of problems in biological sensing.

TI Naturally Stable Free Radical in the Silk Fibroin and Its Structure
   Environment Studied by EPR and DFT
SO SPECTROSCOPY LETTERS
AB EPR spectra of Bombyx mori silk fibroin show a singlet peak at g = 2.0030 +/- 0.0005, which is thought to be a signal of the naturally stable free radical. We found that the intensity of EPR signal increases with the increase in pH of the prepared samples and that the signal recorded at ambient temperature is more symmetric and sharper than that recorded at 100 K. We calculated the H-1 hyperfine coupling constants by the density functional theory (DFT) and simulated the EPR spectrum by the EasySpin software for the tyrosyl radical models. We found that the EPR spectrum of the tyrosyl radical models is dependent sensitively on the local structure of the protein. Furthermore, the calculation demonstrated that the EPR signal of the tyrosyl radical model is isotropic in the model silk fibroin in Silk I conformation, while the signal is anisotropic in the model silk fibroin in Silk II conformation. Therefore, we conclude that the naturally stable free-radical signals observed in the silk fibroin are most likely from the tyrosyl radicals and that the radicals reside in a highly hydrophobic silk fibroin domain in Silk I conformation. It is important to understand the formation mechanism and the lifetime of the free radicals caused by the external factors including molecular structure, pH, heat, light, mechanic force, and the like in the silk fibroin for development of silk applications in the biomaterial field.

TI Microtomographic and morphometric characterization of a bioceramic bone
   substitute in dental implantology
SO ANNALI DELL ISTITUTO SUPERIORE DI SANITA
AB In recent years, bone tissue regeneration studies have led to a deeper knowledge of chemical and structural features of the best biomaterials to be used as replacements for lost bone structures, with the autologus bone still today the only graft material able to ostegenerate, osteinduct and/or osteoconduct. The difficulties of the small available amount of autologus bone, together with morbidity of a second surgical operation on the same patient, have been overcome using both synthetic and biologic substitute bones. The possibility of investigating morphometric characteristics of substitute bones makes it possible to evaluate the predictability of regenerative processes and, so far, a range of different methods have been used for the purpose. X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) is a miniaturized form of conventional tomography, able to analyze the internal structure of small objects, performing three-dimensional images with high spatial resolution (<10 micron pixel size). For a correct analysis, samples need not be altered or treated in any way, as micro-CT is a non-invasive and non-destructive technique. It shows promising results in biomaterial studies and tissue engineering. This work shows the potential applications of this microtomographic technique by means of an in vitro analysis system, in characterizing morphometric features of human bone tissue, and contributes to the use of this technique in studies concerning biomaterials and bioscaffolds inserted in bone tissue.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLYMERIC MATERIALS
AB A number of thin biocomposites were produced from waste corrugated board pulp with 15% and 30% blending of wool fibers (WF), ceramic fibers (CF), and cotton dust (CD), respectively. The highest sound absorption value was obtained from samples containing 30% wool fibers. Printability of control sheets unfortunately was remarkably damaged. Ceramic fibers improved the thermal stability of control sheets, which was followed by WF and CD. Tensile and burst indexes of samples, however, were greatly reduced. It was furthermore found that CD, CF, and WF additions increased the air permeability values of resultant papers parallel to great reduction on densities.

TI Three-dimensional microfiber devices that mimic physiological
   environments to probe cell mechanics and signaling
SO LAB ON A CHIP
AB Many physiological systems are regulated by cells that alter their behavior in response to changes in their biochemical and mechanical environment. These cells experience this dynamic environment through an endogenous biomaterial matrix that transmits mechanical force and permits chemical exchange with the surrounding tissue. As a result, in vitro systems that mimic three-dimensional, in vivo cellular environments can enable experiments that reveal the nuanced interplay between biomechanics and physiology. Here we report the development of a minimal-profile, three-dimensional (MP3D) experimental microdevice that confines cells to a single focal plane, while allowing the precise application of mechanical displacement to cells and concomitant access to the cell membrane for perfusion with biochemical agonists. The MP3D device - an ordered microfiber scaffold erected on glass - provides a cellular environment that induces physiological cell morphologies. Small manipulations of the scaffold's microfibers allow attached cells to be mechanically probed. Due to the scaffold's minimal height profile, MP3D devices confine cells to a single focal plane, facilitating observation with conventional epifluorescent microscopy. When examining fibroblasts within MP3D devices, we observed robust cellular calcium responses to both a chemical stimulus as well as mechanical displacement of the cell membrane. The observed response differed significantly from previously reported, mechanically-induced calcium responses in the same cell type. Our findings demonstrate a key link between environment, cell morphology, mechanics, and intracellular signal transduction. We anticipate that this device will broadly impact research in fields including biomaterials, tissue engineering, and biophysics.

TI SURFACE TREATMENT METHODS FOR TITANIUM IMPLANTS
SO METALURGIA INTERNATIONAL
AB Titanium and its alloys are used for dental implants due to favorable properties such as mechanical strength and biocompatibility. Final processing of implants requires certain surface treatments, performed in order to obtain more rapid tissue integration. The result of these treatments is to modify the surface characteristics such as topography, roughness and chemical composition, that influence the biomaterial osseoconductibility by stimulating osseointegration. The purpose of this paper is to present the current methods of implant surface treatment, providing a review of the literature data. Briefly are presented the characteristics of each method, and also their classification. In addition, are reported the results of different studies on the effectiveness of such methods, in terms of restoring the implants surrounding bone. Also, are presented new trends in this field. Since it is a vast field, there are still many unknowns, which will be studied in further research.

TI SEM sample preparation for cells on 3D scaffolds by freeze-drying and
   HMDS
SO SCANNING
AB Common dehydration methods of cells on biomaterials for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) include air drying, hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) or tetramethysilane (TMS) treatment and critical point drying (CPD). On the other side, freeze-drying has been widely employed in dehydrating biological samples and also in preparing porous biomaterial scaffolds but not in preparing cells on three-dimensional (3D) biomaterials for SEM examination. In this study, we compare cells on porous hydroxyapatite (HA) prepared by air drying, HMDS and freeze-drying. The effects of fixation and using phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in the fixation were also assessed on three porous calcium phosphate (CaP) materials, namely, HA, a-tricalcium phosphate (a-TCP) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) samples. There is no significant difference in samples prepared by HMDS treatment and freeze-drying viewed at low magnification. Besides, it is better not to use phosphate buffer in the fixation step for CaP materials to avoid undesirable spontaneous precipitation of CaPs. On the other hand, fewer exchanges of liquids are required for freeze-drying and hence chemical fixation may not be absolutely required for samples prepared by freeze-drying. Other technical details of the preparation were also investigated and discussed. This study suggests both HMDS and freeze-drying can be employed to dehydrate cells on 3D scaffolds for SEM examination. SCANNING 34: 1225, 2012. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Research on improvement of structure and fabrication methods of the bone implants are carried out for many years. Research are aimed to shape the structures, that will have a Young's modulus value similar to the value of the human bones Young's modulus. Depending on the porosity, Young's moduli can even be tailored to match the modulus of bone closer than solid metals can, thus reducing the problems associated with stress shielding of a human bones. The designed structure should also be characterized by a high abrasion and corrosion resistance to and allow bone ingrowth in the implant material to make the best bone-implant fixation. For this purpose, implants should have a porous structure with an appropriate pore size and with open-cell porosity. Material for bone implants must also have a high biocompatibility and bioactivity. Following these requirements, the metallic porous materials appear to be the most suitable material for bone implants.
   In this paper a various methods of a porous materials fabrication for bone implants are listed. It was shown that titanium and its alloys (e.g. Ti6Al4V or Ti13Nb13Zr) are widely used as biomaterials for implants. Research in order to increase their wear and corrosion resistance and to improve their biocompatibility and bioactivity are still carried out. One of the most effective methods of manufacturing the porous materials is a powder metallurgy (PM).
   In this paper the results of research under shaping the structure of the porous titanium alloy Ti13Nb13Zr are also presented. As a manufacturing method of the porous material from the investigated and mentioned above Ti alloy, the powder metallurgy (PM) was choosen - with and without the use of a space holders. Method of fabrication a spherical powder from the aforementioned Ti alloy and results of its morphology research are discussed. The applied powder compaction method (with use and without use of space holders) and the influence of a sintering process on the final microstructure morphology of porous material obtained from Ti13Nb13Zr alloy are also presented and discussed.

TI Use of porcine small intestinal submucosa for corneal reconstruction in
   dogs and cats: 106 cases
SO JOURNAL OF SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICE
AB OBJECTIVES: To describe the efficacy of porcine small intestinal submucosa in corneal reconstructive surgery in dogs and cats through a large retrospective study.
   METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of 106 cases of surgical reconstruction of the cornea with small intestinal submucosa seen between May 2005 and January 2010 was carried out. The corneal defect was filled by microsurgical grafting of porcine small intestinal submucosa. The biomaterial implant was deposited in one or several layers depending on the depth of the defect. The animals were examined 3, 6 and 12 weeks after surgery.
   RESULTS: Vision was preserved in all eyes at three months post-surgery. In 74 cases (69.8%) the corneal scar was either transparent or discrete, whilst in 32 cases (30.2%) a mild or marked scar was observed. Minor complications occurred in 9 cases (8.5%) with partial integration of the small intestinal submucosa and in 24 cases (22.6%) with faint or mild corneal pigmentation, without impairing vision. In cases followed over a period longer than three months, major complications occurred in five dogs resulting in vision impairment because of pronounced pigmentation.
   CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Corneal grafting of porcine small intestinal submucosa is an effective method for corneal reconstruction resulting in corneal transparency in most cases. It is an excellent alternative to conventional conjunctival grafts.

AB Articular cartilage injury remains one of the major concerns in orthopedic surgery. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has been introduced to avoid some of the side effects and complications of current techniques.. With the aim to evaluate chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, we used Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) microscopy to analyze the aggregation and orientation of collagen fibrils in the hyaline cartilage of rabbit knees. The experiment was performed using implants with type II collagen hydrogel (a biomaterial that mimics the microenvironment of the cartilage), one implant containing MSC and one other without MSC (control). After 10 weeks, the rabbit knees were dissected and fibril collagen distribution and spatial organization in the extracellular matrix of the lesions were verified by SHG. The result showed significant differences, whereas in histological sections of the cartilaginous lesions with MSC the collagen fibers are organized and regular; in the control sections the collagen fibers are more irregular, with absence of cells. A macroscopic analysis of the lesions confirmed this difference, showing a greater percentage of lesions filling in knees treated with MSC than in the knees used as controls. This study demonstrates that SHG microscopy will be an excellent tool to help in the evaluation of the effectiveness of MSC-based cell therapy for cartilage repair.

AB The stress intensity factors (SIFs) of biomaterial interface crack were analyzed using the Composite Grid Method (CGM). Two different scale grids were adopted: a coarse mesh for the whole area without considering interface crack and a fine mesh for the local singular area considering the impact of interface crack. It solved the global coarse mesh problem and the local fine mesh problem iteratively and obtained the final results. The calculation was carried out by CGM but without the demand of dense mesh near the crack tip and special crack tip elements compared with other methods. The numerical extrapolation method of determining the SIFs to avoid the oscillation singularity of asymptotic fields of elastic interface crack. Reasonable agreement was achieved and efficiency of CGM for such kind of problem was displayed.

TI Cell responses to two kinds of nanohydroxyapatite with different sizes
   and crystallinities
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE
AB Introduction: Hydroxyapatite (HA) is the principal inorganic constituent of human bone. Due to its good biocompatibility and osteoconductivity, all kinds of HA particles were prepared by different methods. Numerous reports demonstrated that the properties of HA affected its biological effects.
   Methods: Two kinds of nanohydroxyapatite with different sizes and crystallinities were obtained via a hydrothermal treatment method under different temperatures. It was found that at a temperature of 140 C, a rod-like crystal (n-HA1) with a diameter of 23 +/- 5 nm, a length of 47 +/- 14 nm, and crystallinity of 85% +/- 5% was produced, while at a temperature of 80 degrees C, a -rod-like crystal (n-HA2) with a diameter of 16 +/- 3 nm, a length of 40 +/- 10 nm, and -crystallinity of 65% +/- 3% was produced. The influence of nanohydroxyapatite size and crystallinity on osteoblast viability was studied by MTT, scanning electron microscopy, and flow cytometry.
   Results: n-HA1 gave a better biological response than n-HA2 in promoting cell growth and inhibiting cell apoptosis, and also exhibited much more active cell morphology. Alkaline phosphatase activity for both n-HA2 and n-HA1 was obviously higher than for the control, and no significant difference was found between n-HA1 and n-HA2. The same trend was observed on Western blotting for expression of type I collagen and osteopontin. In addition, it was found by transmission electron microscopy that large quantities of n-HA2 entered into the cell and damaged the cellular morphology. Release of tumor necrosis factor alpha from n-HA2 was markedly higher than from n-HA1, indicating that n-HA2 might trigger a severe inflammatory response.
   Conclusion: This work indicates that not all nanohydroxyapatite should be considered a good biomaterial in future clinical applications.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE
AB Background and methods: A nano calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (n-CDHA)-multi(amino acid) copolymer (MAC) composite bone substitute biomaterial was prepared using an in situ polymerization method. The composition, structure, and compressive strength of the composite was characterized, and the in vitro degradability in phosphate-buffered solution and preliminary cell responses to the composite were investigated.
   Results: The composite comprised n-CDHA and an amide linkage copolymer. The compressive strength of the composite was in the range of 88-129 MPa, varying with the amount of n-CDHA in the MAC (ranging from 10 wt% to 50 wt%). Weight loss from the composite increased (from 32.2 wt% to 44.3 wt%) with increasing n-CDHA content (from 10 wt% to 40 wt%) in the MAC after the composite was soaked in phosphate-buffered solution for 12 weeks. The pH of the soaking medium varied from 6.9 to 7.5. MG-63 cells with an osteogenic phenotype were well adhered and spread on the composite surface. Viability and differentiation increased with time, indicating that the composite had no negative effects on MG-63 cells.
   Conclusion: The n-CDHA-MAC composite had good cytocompatibility and has potential to be used as a bone substitute.

AB We studied peaks of calcium hydroxyapatite - CHA on defects grafted with MTA, treated or not with Light Emitting Diode - LED or IR Laser. 54 rats were divided in 6 groups each subdivided into 3 subgroups (15,21,30d). LED (lambda 850 +/- 10nm) or IR Laser (lambda 850 nm) was applied over (LED) or in 4 points around the defect at 48 h intervals for 15 days. Raman readings were taken at the surface of the defect. The smaller overall intensity of the peak was found in Group MTA + Laser (1510.2 +/- 274.1) and the highest on Group LED (2322 +/- 715). There were no statistically significant differences between non-irradiated subjects on regards the CHA peaks. On the other hand, there were statistically significant differences between the Group Clot and LED, Clot and Laser, and Clot and MTA + Laser (p -0.01, p - 0.02, p = 0.003). There were no significant differences between Group MTA and MTA + LED (p=0.2) but significant differences were seen between Groups MTA and MTA + Laser (p=0.01). Significant differences were also observed between Groups LED and Laser (p <0.001) and between Groups MTA + LED and MTA + Laser (p=0.009). MTA, due to its characteristics, seemed to be directly affected by the light. However, the use of either phototherapy positively affected bone healing similarly as observed on different studies using other biomaterials. The overall analysis of our results indicated that the use of either light source resulted in a better, more advanced, and of quality bone repair.

The fungus was inoculated into different submerged media and the produced red pigment was separated by filtration and methanol extraction from the filtrate. The antioxidant or prooxidant properties of ethanolic extract was evaluated by measuring the quenching ratio of chemiluminescence intensity. The results obtained showed a quenching ration of 87.75% for parental strain, growth 96 h in culture media with 50% maltose. The mutant strain reveals less antioxidant properties, the value of quenching ratio being 4.91%. If the growth time increased, the extract showed a prooxidant activity. At the same time the extract of mutant strain grown 96 H in the culture media containing meat extract reveals excellent antioxidant property, quantified by quenching ratio of 93.36%. When the mutant strain is grown 96 H in a culture media, which contain 30% dextrose, the methanolic extract presents an antioxidant effect with quenching ratio of 98.55%.

Here, the porous structure of cellulosic fibres (chemical wood pulp) was analysed in the wet state by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with and without adsorbed cationic polyelectrolytes. The polyelectrolytes were low molecular weight (M-w) high charge polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide) and two high M-w high charge PDADMACs (poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chlorides)) with well-defined M-w distributions. The porosity changes upon adsorption of cationic polyelectrolytes in the wet-state were followed and the pore analysis gave insights into the distribution of the pores in the wet-state and into the changes of the porous structure in the surface as well as within the whole cell wall. By utilizing the well characterized polyelectrolytes we were able to detect subtle changes in the micropores of cellulosic fibres due to the adsorbed polyelectrolytes. The polymers did not affect the pore volumes in the 2.5-17 nm region upon drying, an important finding considering the porosity. Overall, the cationic polyelectrolytes decreased the pore volume by reducing the osmotic pressure. In addition, the results were compared to a physical state change, i.e., drying and rewetting, to observe and compare the wetting hysteresis of the aforementioned fibres.

TI A three-dimensional polymer scaffolding material exhibiting a zero
   Poisson's ratio
SO SOFT MATTER
AB Poisson's ratio describes the degree to which a material contracts (expands) transversally when axially strained. A material with a zero Poisson's ratio does not transversally deform in response to an axial strain (stretching). In tissue engineering applications, scaffolding having a zero Poisson's ratio (ZPR) may be more suitable for emulating the behavior of native tissues and accommodating and transmitting forces to the host tissue site during wound healing (or tissue regrowth). For example, scaffolding with a zero Poisson's ratio may be beneficial in the engineering of cartilage, ligament, corneal, and brain tissues, which are known to possess Poisson's ratios of nearly zero. Here, we report a 3D biomaterial constructed from polyethylene glycol (PEG) exhibiting in-plane Poisson's ratios of zero for large values of axial strain. We use digital micro-mirror device projection printing (DMD-PP) to create single-and double-layer scaffolds composed of semi-re-entrant pores whose arrangement and deformation mechanisms contribute to the zero Poisson's ratio. Strain experiments prove the zero Poisson's behavior of the scaffolds and that the addition of layers does not change the Poisson's ratio. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) cultured on biomaterials with zero Poisson's ratio demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing these novel materials for biological applications which require little to no transverse deformations resulting from axial strains. Techniques used in this work allow Poisson's ratio to be both scale-independent and independent of the choice of strut material for strains in the elastic regime, and therefore ZPR behavior can be imparted to a variety of photocurable biomaterials.

TI The Peri-Implantitis: Implant Surfaces, Microstructure, and
   Physicochemical Aspects
SO CLINICAL IMPLANT DENTISTRY AND RELATED RESEARCH
AB There are two ways of looking at secondary failures of osseointegration; one is to reflect on possible causes for the failure, the other focuses on the pathology per se. In the first case, background factors such as mechanical trauma (adverse loading) or inflammations/infections are being discussed as the cause of failure. Then peri-implantitis is a term reserved for implant disturbance due to inflammation/infections only. However, irrespective of the original reason for the failure being adverse loading or inflammation/infection, the end result with bone resorption and inflammation may be very similar. Hence, in the present article, an alternative outlook has been chosen. Trigerring factors for peri-implantitis are generally gathered under four categories: lesions of peri-implant attachment, presence of aggressive bacteria, excessive mechanical stress, and corrosion. If only one of these factors would start a chain reaction leading to lesions, then the other factors may combine to worsen the condition. With other words, peri-implantitis is a general term dependent on a synergy of several factors, irrespective of the precise reason for first triggering off symptoms.

TI Viability, Morphology and Function of Primary Endothelial Cells on
   Poly(n-Butyl Acrylate) Networks Having Elastic Moduli Comparable to
   Arteries
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB Soft hydrophobic poly(n-butyl acrylate) networks (cPnBA) were developed as entropy elastic substrates for passive mechanical stimulation of cells, where the elastic modulus of the cPnBAs could be systematically adjusted by variation of the cross-link density. The networks were synthesized by thermally-induced radical polymerization from n-butyl acrylate, with poly(propylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PPGDMA) acting as cross-linker, whereby the purity of the cPnBAs was confirmed by H-1-NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography. In this work two cPnBA polymer networks with an elastic modulus around 200 kPa and 1 MPa were investigated having an elastic modulus similar to that of arteries. Both cPnBAs exhibited an almost smooth surface with a surface roughness (R-q) in the wet state ranging from 17 to 37 nm and a similar zeta-potential, indicating an almost identical chemical composition within the topmost surface layer in terms of functional groups. In contrast, wettability of the samples was found to be different with an advancing angle (theta(advancing)) of 123 +/- 3.8 degrees for cPnBA0250, while for cPnBA1100 significantly lower values for theta(advancing) (111 +/- 3.8 degrees) were obtained. First in vitro tests were performed with primary endothelial cells (HUVEC) to study its effects on vascular cell functions. Within the time period of cultivation (72 h), the cells on the cPnBA samples reached subconfluence and showed a viability rate of almost 100%. Although cell density differed after 72 h with more cells on cPnBA0250 than on cPnBA1100, both materials showed no significant effect on the cell morphology, the cellular LDH-release, which was used as marker for the integrity of the cell membrane, and the organisation of the VE-cadherin. However, lower cell density and less actin stress fibre formation on cPnBA1100 might indicate that cell-material interaction was weaker on cPnBA1100 than on cPnBA0250. The secretion of the vasoactive cytokines prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) was low compared to previously reported values. However, the anti-thrombogenic ratio of PGI2/TXA2 - which is balanced under physiological conditions - with much higher PGI2 compared to TXA2 (up to 17.6-fold after 72 h for cPnBA1100) suggests that this material might be effective to preventing thrombosis.

TI Evaluation of Osteoinduction and Proliferation on Nano-Sr-HAP: A Novel
   Orthopedic Biomaterial for Bone Tissue Regeneration
SO JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Hydroxyapatite (HAP), a CaP compound similar to the mineral phase present in bone, has excellent biocompatibility but little osseous inductivity. In this study, we evaluated the novel nano-Sr-HAP, in which the calcium of hydroxyapatite was substituted with strontium, which acts as a bone-forming agent. Its biocompatibility and osteoinduction were assayed using marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and osteoblasts (OBs) in vitro. We were able to demonstrate that nano-Sr-HAP supported increased OB cell adhesion, proliferation and viability up to 4 days in culture when compared with nano-HAP. MSCs cultured with nano-Sr-HAP showed higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. More extracellular mineralized nodules were found with nano-Sr-HAP compared to nano-HAP, especially in images of ALP staining. We suggest that nano-Sr-HAP powders possess osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties and have the potential to be used in the repair of bone defects caused by osteoporotic fractures.

AB Biomaterials have attracted worldwide attention due to the concerns regarding health and the environment. Silk, a natural protein produced by several species of insects, has been examined as a potential material for applications in many biotechnological and biomedical fields. However, regenerated silk fibroin has poor ductility and mechanical properties. Therefore, in this study, silk fibroin-cellulose composite films were prepared in an aqueous system to increase the ductility of regenerated silk fibroin. The morphology of the silk fibroin-cellulose composite film was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy. The structure of the silk fibroin-cellulose composite films was examined by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy. The flexibility was analyzed using a bending test.

TI Physically crosslinked gelatins functionalized with tyrosine moieties do
   not induce angiogenesis or thrombus formation in the developing
   vasculature in the avian chorioallantoic membrane
SO CLINICAL HEMORHEOLOGY AND MICROCIRCULATION
AB Gelatins functionalized with desaminotyrosine or desaminotyrosyl tyrosine form physically crosslinked polymer networks due to the interactions between the introduced aromatic moeties. In the swollen state, their mechanical properties can be tailored in a range similar to the elasticity of soft tissues. The aim of this study was to evaluate their potential as biomaterials by determining whether these materials - in comparison to plain gelatin - induce bleedings, thrombotic processes, or angiogenesis. These investigations were performed using the hen's egg chorioallantoic membrane (HETCAM) assay. These results indicate that the gelatin-based hydrogels did not possess angiogenic effects and also did not induce bleedings, thrombotic processes or vessel destruction (avascular zones).
   The biocompatibility of the materials in vitro motivates the exploration of their application as matrix in local drug-release systems with short half-life times (1 hour up to several days).

TI Immuno-compatibility of soft hydrophobic poly(n-butyl acrylate) networks
   with elastic moduli for regeneration of functional tissues
SO CLINICAL HEMORHEOLOGY AND MICROCIRCULATION
AB The need for engineered devices to treat cardiovascular diseases is increasing due to an aging population and a changing lifestyle. Soft poly(n-butyl acrylate) (cPnBA) networks were recently described as polymer networks with adjustable mechanical properties and suggested as soft substrates for cells, which could potentially be used for cardiovascular implants. Vascular prostheses designed to be implanted in arteries should have an elasticity similar to blood vessels (elastic modulus at body temperature between 100 and 1200 kPa). Therefore, cPnBA networks with E-moduli of 250 kPa (cPnBA0250) and 1100 kPa (cPnBA1100) were developed. Recently, it was shown that both materials were non-cytotoxic for murin fibroblasts, human primary endothelial cells and human monocytes.
   However, before such newly developed polymers can be used in vivo, it has to be assured that the sterilized materials have a very low endotoxin load to avoid an unspecific activation of the immune system, which otherwise might cause local or systemic inflammatory responses and could lead to severe pathologies.
   In this study we investigated the immuno-compatibility of sterilized cPnBA0250 and cPnBA1100 with the help of an immunocompetent macrophage cell line as well as with whole human blood.

TI Biomaterial surface modifications can dominate cell-substrate mechanics:
   the impact of PDMS plasma treatment on a quantitative assay of cell
   stiffness
SO SOFT MATTER
AB Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a bioinert synthetic polymer with tunable elastic properties that is commonly used as a cell culture substrate. Although plasma treatments are widely used to bio-functionalize otherwise hydrophobic PDMS surfaces, plasma altered surface mechanical properties and implications for cell-substrate mechanical interactions are poorly understood. We performed a multi-scale mechanical characterization of PDMS following plasma treatment: spherical indentation tests were performed with a universal testing machine (indenter diameter, d = 4.75 mm) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) with round tips of 2 different diameters (d = 2 mm, d = 20 mu m). Results indicated substantial surface stiffening at indentation depths up to 1 micron, with exponentially decreasing effects to depths of 1 mm. AFM indentation results were analyzed using a finite element (FE) based optimization to determine the substrate material properties, and thus separate the confounding influence of the underlying substrate on surface indentation experiments. We found that a two-layer material model composed of a thin, stiff plasma-oxidized layer (296 nm and 3.66 MPa, respectively) superimposed on a thick layer of bulk polymer (elastic modulus of 10.5 kPa) was able to robustly fit the experimental data. We then investigated the repercussions of the biopolymer surface modifications on cell mechanics, using an inverse finite element model to interpret cell-matrix force exchange. Estimates of cell elastic modulus neglecting the mechanical effects of plasma treatment were more than an order of magnitude lower than estimates accounting for the surface layer (9.6 +/- 4.2 kPa vs. 124 +/- 55 kPa, respectively). This study thus highlights the need to accurately consider biomaterial surface modifications and how they may influence cell-biomaterial interaction. It further provides a novel approach to characterizing cell-relevant mechanical properties of a polymer substrate. These advances may lead to an improved quantitative assessment of actin cytoskeleton function, with potential relevance to biomaterial based therapies.

AB A search for design solutions for grain grinding devices offering energy-saving production processes justify the research into the improvement of the theory and the design of grinders. The efficiency, functionality and performance of the rice grains grinding are significantly influenced by processes, difficult to describe, occurring within the working space of the grinder. Although there are some studies on the principles of the functionality and analysis of multi-disc grinders, an attempt has not been made so far at describing the influence of features and behaviour of ground material on efficiency, performance and usefulness of the biomaterial comminution/grinding process. The basis for the improvement of the functionality of a grinding device is an analysis of the potential of existing solutions and a determination of the scope of effective design features of the working unit within the permissible area. The criteria may be fulfilled by objective-oriented control of the design features of the multi-disc unit. In order for these actions to be effective, relevant relationships need to be explored and a mathematical description needs to be developed for the flow of ground grains through the working space of a multi-disc grinder, as a result variable of the structure and the operation of a working unit.

AB Hydrogel dressings are soft biomaterials that need protection from external influences. Polymer sheets such as breathable film (BF) or breathable laminate (BL) were characterized in respect of water vapor transmission, water contact angle, microbial penetrability, and antimicrobial property to protect hydrogel dressings. The mechanical property and water retention ability of hydogels PVP-CMC and PVP-CMC-BA with and without BF and BL have been examined. Hydrogels covered with either BF or BL show better mechanical flexibility; however, their water retention capacity increases reasonably. The determined efficient properties of polymer sheets established that BF is better than BL as a protective sheet cover for hydrogel dressings.

TI Biomimetic composites and stem cells interaction for bone and cartilage
   tissue regeneration
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
AB Development of bone and cartilage are emerging as prominent techniques in the field of tissue engineering because of the abundance of problems caused by disease, injury and trauma. Bone is the main supporting system of the body, a biocomposite of elements and tissues which is responsible for the excellent tensile and loading strength. Cartilage is an avascular, aneural and alymphatic tissue and does not have regenerative capabilities, so a great amount of assistance is required from outside to repair the defect site. Autografts and allografts are useful in the case of bone defects, but still they require a second surgery from the donor, and transmission of diseases are also possible. The objective of this review is to discuss the approaches that have been taken in bone and cartilage tissue engineering with an emphasis on the cell sources such as embryonic stem cells, adipose derived stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells and progenitor stem cells. A potential scaffold is also important for the mechanical and cellular functions for bone and cartilage regeneration. Awareness will be spanned over different types of scaffolds such as biomaterial scaffolds, nanofibrous scaffolds and hydrogels. The ultimate aim is to focus on the basic aspects and the importance of various signaling and growth factors for tissue engineering, used for tissues that have a poor self healing capacity, such as cartilage, or when defects are too big for the body's capacity to heal itself, such as large bone defects.

TI Treatment of venous ulcers with bone marrow-impregnated collagen matrix
SO JOURNAL OF PLASTIC SURGERY AND HAND SURGERY
AB Bone marrow attracted our attention as a potentially beneficial material for the treatment of wounds, because it contains multipotential progenitor cells and produces growth factors. We impregnated autologous bone marrow cells on to a collagen matrix that had been used for the treatment of chronic wounds. The bone marrow-impregnated collagen matrix was then as a biomaterial scaffold for the treatment of wounds. This study was designed with the aim of clinically evaluating the effects of bone marrow-impregnated collagen matrix on wound healing of venous ulcers. We applied the matrix in 15 patients with chronic venous ulcers, and evaluated the transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) and vascular density. The application of the matrix induced healthy granulation tissue. All patients were given a split-thickness skin graft on to the induced granulation tissue, and have remained free from complications for more than eight months since the treatment. The mean (SD) vascular density at the ulcer base increased after the treatment (before 0.011 (0.006) mm(2)/mm(2), after 0.064 (0.036) mm(2)/mm(2), p < 0.001). The periwound TcPO2 values tended to increase (before 17.1 (12.7) mmHg, after 30.6 (13.4) mmHg, p < 0.001). Our results have shown the efficacy of bone marrow-impregnated collagen matrix for the treatment of intractable venous ulcers.

TI Formation and size distribution of pores in poly(epsilon-caprolactone)
   foams prepared by pressure quenching using supercritical CO2
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS
AB Many biomaterial-based regenerative therapies require foam structures, which temporarily mimic the extracellular matrix. The pore structure of these scaffolds needs to be tailored to the specific requirements of the clinical application. Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) is a semi-crystalline, aliphatic polyester, which is applied as degradable implant material. In this paper we explored how thermodynamic and kinetic conditions in a supercritical CO2 (scCO(2)) supported foaming process influence the final morphology of the foam. With help of a view cell, we have systematically investigated the foaming with scCO(2) in the pressure range from 78 to 200 bar at temperatures between 25 and 50 degrees C. Foams were obtained both above the pressure dependent melting temperature (T-m) but also below this temperature, i.e. from supercooled melt states. Foams were characterized by mu CT X-ray computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy. The pore size distributions of the obtained foams show characteristic properties (widths, maxima) depending on the initial thermodynamic state of the CO2/PCL system before pressure quenching, the rate of the pressure decay, and the thermal history of the system. We try to rationalize the dependency of foam morphology and quench conditions with thermodynamic model calculations. The initial amount of CO2 in the PCL melt was calculated with the Sanchez-Lacombe equation of state. Pressure quenching with a slow pressure decay rate is considered an isothermal process where for a fast rate an adiabatic process is assumed. Both processes differ in their phase separation mechanism. It turned out that the CO2-induced melting point depression of the semi-crystalline polymer is an important factor. The variation of foaming conditions allows the preparation of scaffolds with specific morphological parameters (mean pore size, pore distribution, and pore connectivity). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI Heme Redox Cycling in Soybean Peroxidase: Hypothetical Model and
   Supportive Data
SO SENSORS AND MATERIALS
AB In plants, the peroxidase family is involved in a great deal of oxidation reactions essential for living cells, using H2O2 as an electron acceptor and a variety of substrates as electron donors. Nowadays, plant peroxidases are widely used as biological sensing materials in various areas such as medical diagnosis, biosensors, and nanotechnology. Among plant peroxidases, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and soybean peroxiclase (SBP) are widely used as model enzymes applicable to various purposes. For the purpose of providing a basis for future innovation by using SBP as a sensing material,. we focus on the behavior of purified SBP in responses to known plant peroxidase substrates reportedly involved in superoxide-generating reactions. A chemiluminescence study showed that SBP can catalyze the generation of superoxide in the presence of salicylic acid and indole-3-acetic acid used as the tester substrates for examining the involvement of the conventional peroxidase cycle (involving native form, Compounds I and II) and oxygenase cycle (involving native form, ferrous form, and Compound III), respectively. Enzyme intermediates in the above two redox cycles were spectroscopically determined by recording the typical spectra reflecting the presence of Compound II (peroxidise cycle) and Compound III (oxygenase cycle). Interestingly, addition of nitric oxide in the absence of H2O2 resulted in the formation of an intermediate resembling Compound II, the catalytically active form in the peroxidase cycle; thus, the novel gaseous regulation of SBP-mediated reaction was proposed.

TI Biodegradable Orthopedic Magnesium-Calcium (MgCa) Alloys, Processing,
   and Corrosion Performance
SO MATERIALS
AB Magnesium-Calcium (Mg-Ca) alloy has received considerable attention as an emerging biodegradable implant material in orthopedic fixation applications. The biodegradable Mg-Ca alloys avoid stress shielding and secondary surgery inherent with permanent metallic implant materials. They also provide sufficient mechanical strength in load carrying applications as opposed to biopolymers. However, the key issue facing a biodegradable Mg-Ca implant is the fast corrosion in the human body environment. The ability to adjust degradation rate of Mg-Ca alloys is critical for the successful development of biodegradable orthopedic implants. This paper focuses on the functions and requirements of bone implants and critical issues of current implant biomaterials. Microstructures and mechanical properties of Mg-Ca alloys, and the unique properties of novel magnesium-calcium implant materials have been reviewed. Various manufacturing techniques to process Mg-Ca based alloys have been analyzed regarding their impacts on implant performance. Corrosion performance of Mg-Ca alloys processed by different manufacturing techniques was compared. In addition, the societal and economical impacts of developing biodegradable orthopedic implants have been emphasized.

TI Biosorption of chromium(VI), nickel(II) and Remazol Blue by Rhodotorula
   muciloginosa biomass
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The passive removal of commonly used reactive dye and two heavy metals, from aqueous solutions by inexpensive biomaterial, yeast Rhodotorula muciloginosa biomass, termed biosorption, was studied with respect to pH, initial dye concentration and initial metal ion concentration. The biomass exhibited maximum dye and chromium(VI) uptake at pH 5 and pH 6 for nickel(II) in media containing 50 mg/L heavy metal and 50 mg/L remazol blue. It was found that the highest chromium(VI) removal yields measured were 31.3% for 49.0 mg/l initial chromium(VI) concentrations. The nickel(II) removal yield was 32.5% for 22.3 mg/L. Higher R. Blue removal yields were obtained, such as 77.1% for 117.5 mg/L. The maximum dye biosorption yield was investigated in medium with a constant dye (similar to 50 mg/L) and increasing heavy metal concentration. In the medium with 48.8, 103.8 and 151.8 mg/L chromium(VI) and constant dye concentration, the maximum chromium(VI) biosorption was 7.4, 9.3 and 17.1%, whereas the maximum dye biosorption was 61.6, 56.6 and 55.9%. The maximum nickel(II) biosorptions in the medium with dye were 38.1, 22.1 and 8.8% at 23.7, 37.7 and 60.1 mg/L nickel(II) concentrations. In these media, dye biosorptions were 93.9, 86.4 and 93.3%, respectively.

TI Poly-lactic acid synthesis for application in biomedical devices - A
   review
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVANCES
AB Bioabsorbable polymers are considered a suitable alternative to the improvement and development of numerous applications in medicine. Poly-lactic acid (PLA,) is one of the most promising biopolymers due to the fact that the monomers may produced from non toxic renewable feedstock as well as is naturally occurring organic acid. Lactic acid can be made by fermentation of sugars obtained from renewable resources as such sugarcane. Therefore, PLA is an eco-friendly product with better features for use in the human body (nontoxicity). Lactic acid polymers can be synthesized by different processes so as to obtain products with an ample variety of chemical and mechanical properties. Due to their excellent biocompatibility and mechanical properties, PLA and their copolymers are becoming widely used in tissue engineering for function restoration of impaired tissues. In order to maximize the benefits of its use, it is necessary to understand the relationship between PLA material properties, the manufacturing process and the final product with desired characteristics. In this paper, the lactic acid production by fermentation and the polymer synthesis such biomaterial are reviewed. The paper intends to contribute to the critical knowledge and development of suitable use of PLA for biomedical applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI In vitro and in vivo bioactivity of CoBlast hydroxyapatite coating and
   the effect of impaction on its osteoconductivity
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVANCES
AB The novel non-thermal CoBlast process has been used recently to create a hydroxyapatite coating on metallic substrates with improved biological response compared to an uncoated implant. In this study, we compared the biological effect of coatings deposited by this process and the industrial standard technique - plasmaspray. Physicochemical properties of these two coatings have been found to be significantly different in that CoBlast HA is less rough but more hydrophilic than the plasma-spray HA as evidenced by data obtained from profilometry and goniometry. Mesenchymal stem cell attachment and adhesion are enhanced on CoBlast HA. Analysis by a combination of EDX and ICP suggests that the higher crystallinity retained by the CoBlast HA result in slower coating dissolution. Detailed in vitro evaluation reveals that plasma-spray HA might induce slightly faster cell proliferation and earlier osteogenic differentiation, but CoBlast HA becomes equivalent to it by the late osteogenic stage. PCR array facilitated the identification of differentially regulated genes involved in various functional aspects of in vitro osteogenesis by the CoBlast HA coating. The expression level of the functional protein products of these genes are in agreement with the PCR data. Coating metallic screws with HA significantly improves the in vivo osseointegration. By measuring of removal force using torque measurement instrument and analyzing the patterns found in X-ray images it is demonstrated that the two HA coatings elicit comparable osseointegration. Using simulated impaction model, CoBlast HA is shown to maintain better performance in cell attachment and mineralization than plasma-spray HA, especially following significant impactions. This might indicate a potentially greater osteoconductivity of CoBlast HA coating in shear-stress associated surgical applications. Collectively, it was demonstrated that CoBlast HA is an effective alternative to plasma-spray HA coating and a promising replacement for specialized surgical applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The product was characterized by mean of UV and IR spectra, scanning electronic microscopy, optical microscopy and laser diffractometry. The results clearly show a high level of order in the membranes obtained by both techniques. Permeability for rifamycin, ascorbic acid and NaCl was also measured. Due to the characteristics of the membranes, they have a potential application for treatment of surface injuries. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2012

TI Femtosecond laser printing of living cells using absorbing film-assisted
   laser-induced forward transfer
SO OPTICAL ENGINEERING
AB The applicability of a femtosecond KrF laser in absorbing film-assisted, laser-induced forward transfer of living cells was studied. The absorbing materials were 50-nm-thick metal films and biomaterials (gelatine, Matrigel, each 50 mu m thick, and polyhydroxybutyrate, 2 mu m). The used cell types were human neuroblastoma, chronic myeloid leukemia, and osteogenic sarcoma cell lines, and primary astroglial rat cells. Pulses of a 500-fs KrF excimer laser focused onto the absorbing layer in a 250-mu m diameter spot with 225 mJ/cm(2) fluence were used to transfer the cells to the acceptor plate placed at 0.6 mm distance, which was a glass slide either pure or covered with biomaterials. While the low-absorptivity biomaterial absorbing layers proved to be ineffective in transfer of cells, when applied on the surface of acceptor plate, the wet gelatine and Matrigel layers successfully ameliorated the impact of the cells, which otherwise did not survive the arrival onto a hard surface. The best short- and long-term survival rate was between 65% and 70% for neuroblastoma and astroglial cells. The long-term survival of the transferred osteosarcoma cells was low, while the myeloid leukemia cells did not tolerate the procedure under the applied experimental conditions.

TI Calcium Phosphate Cement in Orbital Reconstructions
SO JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY
AB Treatment of facial trauma sequelae is a complex and challenging process. There is still controversy over suitable materials for orbital wall reconstruction. This study evaluated calcium phosphate cement (CPC) implants manufactured by rapid prototyping in the repair of orbital wall defects secondary to trauma. Computed tomographic scans of 5 patients were used for surgery planning and production of CPC implants. Implants were used to restore orbital wall anatomy, ocular alignment, and facial contour. Benefits resulting from the use of implants, such as a reduced operating time, patient response to biomaterial implantation, biomaterial integrity and stability, and patient satisfaction with treatment, were analyzed qualitatively. Our results suggest that CPC is an effective and safe material for orbital reconstruction because of its biocompatibility and easy production and placement.

TI Autogenous Bone Graft: Basic Science and Clinical Implications
SO JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY
AB No single biomaterial is optimum for every craniomaxillofacial application. Instead, surgeons should consider the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative in a given clinical situation, and select the material with lowest overall cost and morbidity, and the highest likelihood of success. Autogenous bone is still considered the gold standard for most applications; it becomes vascularized and osseointegrates with surrounding bone, thus minimizing the risk of infection, dislodgement, or break-down. Limitations include added operative time for graft harvest, donor site morbidity, graft resorption, molding challenges, and limited availability, especially in the pediatric population. Numerous alternatives to bone graft have become available to address these limitations; unfortunately, most of these products are expensive, do not osseointegrate, and have unpredictable biologic activity. Understanding the physiologic behavior of autogenous bone graft can help clarify the indications for its use and provide a conceptual framework for achieving the best possible outcome when this alternative is chosen.

TI Gene Therapy: Implications for Craniofacial Regeneration
SO JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY
AB Gene therapy in the craniofacial region provides a unique tool for delivery of DNA to coordinate protein production in both time and space. The drive to bring this technology to the clinic is derived from the fact that more than 85% of the global population may at one time require repair or replacement of a craniofacial structure. This need ranges from mild tooth decay and tooth loss to temporomandibular joint disorders and large-scale reconstructive surgery. Our ability to insert foreign DNA into a host cell has been developing since the early uses of gene therapy to alter bacterial properties for waste cleanup in the 1980s followed by successful human clinical trials in the 1990s to treat severe combined immunodeficiency. In the past 20 years, the emerging field of craniofacial tissue engineering has adopted these techniques to enhance regeneration of mineralized tissues, salivary gland, and periodontium and to reduce tumor burden of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Studies are currently pursuing research on both biomaterial-mediated gene delivery and more clinically efficacious, although potentially more hazardous, viral methods. Although hundreds of gene therapy clinical trials have taken place in the past 20 years, we must still work to ensure an ideal safety profile for each gene and delivery method combination. With adequate genotoxicity testing, we can expect gene therapy to augment protein delivery strategies and potentially allow for tissue-specific targeting, delivery of multiple signals, and increased spatial and temporal control with the goal of natural tissue replacement in the craniofacial complex.

AB Design of elementary molecular logic gates is the key and the fundamental of performing complicated Boolean calculations. Herein, we report a strategy for constructing a DNA-based OR gate by using the mechanism of sequence recognition and the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). In this system, the gate is entirely composed of a single strand of DNA (A, B and C) and the inputs are the molecular beacon probes (MB1 and MB2). Changes in fluorescence intensity confirm the realization of the OR logic operation and electrophoresis experiments verify these results. Our successful application of DNA to perform the binary operation represents that DNA can serve as an efficient biomaterial for designing molecular logic gates and devices.

AB Hydroxyapatite is the main component of human hard tissues such as bones and teeth. Because it has a great biocompatibility with human organism, it is used as biomaterial with the purpose of form and repair hard tissues. Hydroxyapatite is formulated as Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2) and shows high stability under physiological conditions. In this study, biomimetic hydroxyapatite powder has been synthesized using by synthetic body fluids which has the same composition as human blood plasma. Moreover, the effect of different precursors on properties of synthesized powders has been investigated. For that purpose calcium nitrate tetrahydrate [Ca(NO3)(2)center dot 4H(2)O], calcium chloride [CaCl2], calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)(2)] and diammonium hydrogen phosphate [(NH4)(2)HPO4] were used as precursors. Mainly literature focused on the synthesis of hydroxyapatite powders was carried out using chemical method. However, in this study, the synthesis of hydroxyapatite powder is carried out using biomimetic method. Chemical structures of synthesized powders have been investigated by the Fourier transform infrared and X-ray diffraction methods. Results showed that synthesized powders have a pure hydroxyapatite structure. Surface area of the synthesized powders was measured by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. Morphological structures have been characterized by using scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, particle size of powders was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. It was clearly seen that morphological properties of biomimetic hydroxyapatite have affected the use of different calcium precursors.

TI Designing biomaterials for in situ periodontal tissue regeneration
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRESS
AB The regeneration of periodontal tissue poses a significant challenge to biomaterial scientists, tissue engineers and periodontal clinicians. Recent advances in this field have shifted the focus from the attempt to recreate tissue replacements/constructs ex vivo to the development of biofunctionalized biomaterials that incorporate and release regulatory signals in a precise and near-physiological fashion to achieve in situ regeneration. The molecular and physical information coded within the biomaterials define a local biochemical and mechanical niche with complex and dynamic regulation that establishes key interactions with host endogenous cells and, hence, may help to unlock latent regenerative pathways in the body by instructing cell homing and regulating cell proliferation/differentiation. In the future, these innovative principles and biomaterial devices promise to have a profound impact on periodontal reconstructive therapy and are also likely to reconcile the clinical and commercial pressures on other tissue engineering endeavors.

TI The crucial role of trimerization domains in collagen folding
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & CELL BIOLOGY
AB Collagens contain large numbers of Gly-Xaa-Yaa peptide repeats that form the characteristic triple helix, where the individual chains fold into a polyproline II helix and three of these helices form a right-handed triple helix. For the proper folding of the triple helix collagens contain trimerization domains. These domains ensure a single starting point for triple helix formation and are also responsible for the chain selection in heterotrimeric collagens. Trimerization domains are non-collagenous domains of very different structures. The size of trimerization domains varies from 35 residues in type IX collagen to around 250 residues for the fibrillar collagens. These domains are not only crucial for biological functions, but they are also attractive tools for generating recombinant collagen fragments of interest as well as for general use in protein engineering and biomaterial design. Here we review the current knowledge of the structure and function of these trimerization domains. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To overcome the limitations of traditionally used autografts, allografts and, to a lesser extent, synthetic materials, there is the need to develop a new generation of scaffolds with adequate mechanical and structural support, control of cell attachment, migration, proliferation and differentiation and with bio-resorbable features. This suite of properties would allow the body to heal itself at the same rate as implant degradation. Genetic engineering offers a route to this level of control of biomaterial systems. The possibility of expressing biological components in nature and to modify or bioengineer them further, offers a path towards multifunctional biomaterial systems. This includes opportunities to generate new protein sequences, new self-assembling peptides or fusions of different bioactive domains or protein motifs. New protein sequences with tunable properties can be generated that can be used as new biomaterials.
   In this review we address some of the most frequently used proteins for tissue engineering and biomedical applications and describe the techniques most commonly used to functionalize protein-based biomaterials by combining them with bioactive molecules to enhance biological performance. We also highlight the use of genetic engineering, for protein heterologous expression and the synthesis of new protein-based biopolymers, focusing the advantages of these functionalized biopolymers when compared with their counterparts extracted directly from nature and modified by techniques such as physical adsorption or chemical modification.

TI Removal of hexavalent chromium in tannery wastewater by Bacillus cereus
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB Bacillus cereus was used to remove chromium (Cr(VI)) from medium containing tannery wastewater under different conditions. The maximum rate of Cr(VI) removal was attained at a temperature of 37 degrees C, pH of 7.0-9.0, and biomass of 20 g/L when the initial Cr(VI) concentration was less than 50 mg/L. Under the optimum conditions, the Cr(VI) in tannery wastewater was treated with each cellular component of B. cereus to detect its ability to reduce Cr(VI). The results showed that the removal rate of Cr(VI) for the cell-free extracts could reach 92.70%, which was close to that of the whole cells (96.85%), indicating that the Cr(VI) reductase generated by B. cereus is primarily intracellular. Additionally, during continuous culture of the B. cereus, the strain showed good consecutive growth and removal ability. After treatment of 20 mg/L Cr(VI) for 48 h, the B. cereus was observed by SEM and TEM-EDX. SEM images showed that the B. cereus used to treat Cr(VI) grew well and had a uniform cellular size. TEM-EDX analysis revealed large quantities of chromium in the B. cereus cells used to treat Cr(VI). Overall, the results presented herein demonstrate that B. cereus can be used as a new biomaterial to remove Cr(VI) from tannery wastewater.

TI A Prospective 1-Year Clinical and Radiographic Study of Implants Placed
   after Maxillary Sinus Floor Augmentation with Synthetic Biphasic Calcium
   Phosphate or Deproteinized Bovine Bone
SO CLINICAL IMPLANT DENTISTRY AND RELATED RESEARCH
AB Background: The technique of using bone grafts or different biomaterials for augmentation of the maxillary sinus prior to implant placement is well accepted by clinicians. However, clinical documentation of some bone substitutes is still lacking.
   Purpose: This prospective study was designed to evaluate the success rate of implants placed after maxillary sinus augmentation with a novel synthetic biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) or deproteinized bovine bone (DBB), the latter acting as control.
   Material and Methods: Nine edentulous patients and two partially edentulous patients with a mean age of 67 years with a bilateral need for sinus augmentation, < 5 mm residual bone in the floor of the sinus and a crestal width 34 mm, were included in the study. After bilateral elevation of the Schneiderian membrane, all patients were randomized for augmentation with synthetic BCP in one side and DBB in the contralateral side. After 8 months of graft healing, 62 implants with an SLActive surface were placed. Implant survival, graft resorption, plaque index, bleeding on probing, sulcus bleeding index, probing pocket depth, and implant success rate were evaluated after 1 year of functional loading.
   Results: After a mean of 118 days, all patients received their fixed prosthetic constructions. One implant was lost in each biomaterial, giving an overall survival rate of 96.8%. Success rates for implants placed in BCP and DBB were 91.7 and 95.7%, respectively. No significant difference in marginal bone loss was found around implants placed in BCP, DBB, or residual bone, respectively. The mean graft resorption was 0.43 mm (BCP) and 0.29 mm (DBB).
   Conclusion: In this limited study, implant success rate was not dependent on the biomaterial used for maxillary sinus augmentation. Similar results were found after 1 year of functional loading for implants placed after sinus augmentation using BCP or DBB.

TI Bilateral Sinus Elevation Evaluating Plasma Rich in Growth Factors
   Technology: A Report of Five Cases
SO CLINICAL IMPLANT DENTISTRY AND RELATED RESEARCH
AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) technology and its autologous formulations in five consecutive patients in which bilateral sinus lift augmentation was carried out.
   Material and Methods: Five consecutive patients received bilateral sinus floor augmentation. All patients presented a residual bone height of class D (1-3 mm). The effects of PRGF combined with bovine anorganic bone ( one side) were compared with the biomaterial alone ( contralateral side). The effects of using liquid PRGF to maintain the bone window and autologous fibrin membrane to seal the defect were evaluated. A complete histological and histomorphometrical analysis was performed 5 months after surgery.
   Results: One patient was excluded from the study as the Schneiderian membrane of the control side was perforated during the surgery. In two patients, the biopsies obtained from the control sides 5 months postsurgery were not acceptable for processing. PRGF technology facilitated the surgical approach of sinus floor elevation. The control area was more inflamed than the area treated with PRGF technology. Patients referred also to an increased sensation of pain in the control area. PRGF-treated samples had more new vital bone than controls. In patient number 1, image processing revealed 21.4% new vital bone in the PRGF area versus 8.4% in the control area, whereas in patient number 2, 28.4% new vital bone was quantified in the PRGF area compared with the 8.2% of the control side. The immunohistochemical processing of the biopsies revealed that the number of blood vessels per square millimeter of connective tissue was 116 vessels in the PRGF sample versus 7 in the control biopsy.
   Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that from a practical point of view, PRGF may present a role in reducing tissue inflammation after surgery, increasing new bone formation and promoting the vascularization of bone tissue.

AB Although magnesium as degradable biomaterial already showed clinical proof of concepts, the design of new alloys requires predictive in vitro methods, which are still lacking. Incubation under cell culture conditions to obtain "physiological" corrosion may be a solution. The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of different solutions, addition of proteins and of oxygen availability on the corrosion of different magnesium materials (pure Mg, WE43, and E11) with different surface finishing. Oxygen content in solution, pH, osmolality and ion release were determined. Corrosion led to a reduction of oxygen in solution. The influence of oxygen on pH was enhanced by proteins, while osmolality was not influenced. Magnesium ion release was solution-dependent and enhanced in the initial phase by proteins with delayed release of alloying elements. The main corrosion product formed was magnesium carbonate. Therefore, cell culture conditions are proposed as first step toward physiological corrosion.

TI Effects of different biomaterials: Comparing the bladder smooth muscle
   cells on waterborne polyurethane or poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid
   membranes
SO KAOHSIUNG JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB Tissue engineering materials have often been used to repair bladder damage caused by conditions, such as infection, resection, inflammation, and trauma. However, the concept of generating a functional urinary bladder using autologous cells obtained from a biopsy specimen combined with a biomaterial scaffold remains a challenge. Previously, we presented a new method for synthesizing a biocompatible, mechanically sound, nontoxic, and cross-linked waterborne polyurethane (WBPU) as a potential material for bladder regeneration. Here, we further evaluated the response of bladder smooth muscle cells (BSMCs) seeded on WBPU membranes in comparison with the gold standard biomaterial, poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid. Specifically, we observed the BSMC: attachment, proliferation, and a alpha-actin distribution at 1 day, 3 days, and 5 days after membrane seeding. We found that significantly more cells attached and proliferated on the WBPU membranes after 3 days and 5 days of culture, and the cells exhibited greater organization and a wider distribution of a-actin compared with BSMCs cultured on poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid membranes. These preliminary data offer promise for the use of WBPU biomaterials in bladder tissue engineering. Copyright (C) 2011, Elsevier Taiwan LLC. All rights reserved.

TI Pediatric perfusion in Japan: 2010 practice survey
SO PERFUSION-UK
AB We report here Japan's first pediatric perfusion survey. It covers practices from January 2007 through December 2009. Of the 70 congenital heart centers contacted, 53 (76%) completed the survey. They reported performing 3,379 pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) procedures in 2009, 3,408 in 2008, and 3,358 in 2007. Twenty-eight percent of all centers used CPB circuits with a priming volume between 151-200 ml. All centers used pre-bypass ultrafiltration and only 6% used retrograde autologous priming. A biomaterial-coated circuit was used by 78% of the centers, a roller pump as the arterial pump by 91%, vacuum-assisted venous drainage by 39%, dilutional ultrafiltration by 48%, and modified ultrafiltration at the end of the procedure by 30%. A regional oxygen saturation monitor was used by 69% of the centers and high flow (150-200 ml/kg/min) management with alpha-stat blood gas control was standard during moderate to normothermic CPBs. Crystalloid cardioplegia solution was used as myocardial protection by 56% of the centers, electronic recording of monitoring data by 51%. The centers performed 98 pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedures in 2007, 109 in 2008, and 119 in 2009; 58% of the centers used a centrifugal pump. This survey provides a description of the current practice in Japan. Future surveys will identify trends and rate of change in practice.

TI Visible light activity of Ag-loaded and guanidine nitrate-doped
   nano-TiO2: degradation of dichlorophenol and antibacterial properties
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB To utilize visible light, Ag loaded and C, N-doped nano-TiO2 was prepared using a "one pot'' synthesis utilizing mild reaction conditions and benign precursors. The synthesis was optimized using appropriate experiment design that took the silver content and calcination temperature into account. The optimized nanocatalyst was characterized by XRD, BET, TEM, TGA, XPS as well as UV-DRS. Nanocatalysts were predominantly anatase as confirmed by XRD, thermally stable up to 1100 degrees C, as revealed by TGA studies and exhibited absorption in the visible light region as verified by UV-DRS analysis. Moreover, XPS results proved that Ag was dispersed on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles and nitrogen, as well as carbon from guanidine nitrate was interlaced into the matrix of TiO2. Co-doping of TiO2 suppressed charge recombination and improved the visible light photoactivity up to the complete degradation of dichlorophenol (DCP) in 4 h of the reaction. Degradation followed first order reaction kinetics with k(app) ranging from 1.1 to as high as 15.1 x 10(-3) min(-1) depending on the silver content and calcination temperature. Demineralization of the solution in terms of TOC was up to 92%. A complete elimination of Vibrio fischeri was accomplished with 1 mg L-1 of the nanocatalyst regardless of the Ag content.

TI Electric-field controlled liposome formation with embedded
   superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles
SO CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS OF LIPIDS
AB Liposomes are one of the most promising biomaterial carriers to deliver DNA,(1) proteins, drugs and medicine in human bodies. However, artificially formed liposomes have to satisfy some crucial functions such as: (i) to efficiently carry drugs to targeted systems, (ii) to be biologically stable until they are removed from human body, (iii) to be biodegradable, and (iv) to be sufficiently small in size for effective drug delivery. Here, we report an efficient and novel method to simultaneously manufacture and incorporate super-paramagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (efficient target finder in the presence of external magnetic field) into the liposome's interior and its bilayer. In this technique, we use electric field to control the formation of liposomes and the incorporation of iron oxide nanoparticles. Our preparation procedure does not require any chemical or ultrasound treatments. Apart from that, we also provide further experimental investigations on the role of electric fields on the formation of liposomes using XPS2 and the magnetic-optical microscope.

TI Study of biomaterial-induced macrophage activation, cell-mediated immune
   response and molecular oxidative damage in patients with dermal
   bioimplants
SO IMMUNOBIOLOGY
AB Several soft-tissue dermal fillers have been reported to provoke immunogenicity and may cause adverse reactions despite claims regarding their safety. This study aimed to assess biomaterial-induced macrophage activation, cell-mediated immune response and oxidative stress in 169 patients with dermal bioimplants. To this end, we analysed plasma concentrations of myeloperoxidase (MPO), the chitinase-like proteins chitotriosidase and YKL-40 and molecular oxidative damage. The present study shows, for the first time, that the components of innate immunity: chitotriosidase and YKL-40, are significantly higher in patients with certain bioimplants and these markers of monocyte/macrophage activation rose progressively as adverse reactions (AR) evolved. Plasma MPO levels increased 4-fold in filler users with AR and 3-fold in those without. Analysis by filler type showed subjects injected with calcium hydroxylapatite, methacrylate, acrylamides and silicone to have values significantly above those of non-filler subjects for at least two plasma biomarkers, probably because the afore-mentioned biomaterials are permanent and prone to trigger AR in the long term. By contrast, hyaluronic acid alone elicited little immune response. Plasma concentrations of markers of oxidative damage to lipids and proteins were found to be significantly higher in users of four of the nine dermal fillers studied. These diffusible products of molecular peroxidation would stem from the reaction catalysed by MPO that generates potent oxidants, leading to cell oxidative damage which, in turn, may exert deleterious effects on the organism. Overall, the results of this study on the effects of a range of dermal fillers point to chronic activation of the immune response mediated by macrophages and PMNs. The increases in plasma of MPO, chitotriosidase and YKL-40 proteins and products of macromolecular peroxidation suggests that these molecules could serve as blood-based biochemical markers and alert to the risk of chronic immune system activation and development of adverse events that may arise from the use of certain bioimplants.

SO JOURNAL OF BIOACTIVE AND COMPATIBLE POLYMERS
AB The effects of an amphiphilic polymer coating of poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate) (PMEA) on immunoglobulin adsorption and leukocyte adhesion were investigated. Forty patients were operated on using noncoated and PMEA-coated oxygenator fibers; leukocyte counts adhered onto the noncoated and coated fibers. It appears that the adsorbed immunoglobulin on noncoated fiber surfaces plays a role in leukocyte adhesion and complement activation by an alternative pathway, while the PMEA coating reduced the complement activation on the oxygenator hollow fibers. The biomaterial and blood interaction at the interface could potentially be used as an indicator for predicting the artificial devices long-term clinical performance.

TI Proteomic and Transcriptomic Analyses of Rigid and Membranous Cuticles
   and Epidermis from the Elytra and Hindwings of the Red Flour Beetle,
   Tribolium castaneum
SO JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH
AB The insect cuticle is a composite biomaterial made up primarily of chitin) and proteins. The physical properties of the cuticle can vary greatly from hard and rigid to soft and flexible. Understanding how different cuticle types are assembled can aid in the development of novel biomimetic materials for use in medicine and technology. Toward this goal, we have taken a combined proteomics and transcriptomics approach with the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, to examine the protein and gene expression profiles of the elytra and hindwings, appendages that contain rigid and soft cuticles, respectively. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis revealed distinct differences in the protein profiles between elytra and hindwings, with four highly abundant proteins dominating the elytral cuticle extract. MALDI/TOF mass spectrometry identified 19 proteins homologous to known or hypothesized cuticular proteins (CPs), including a novel low complexity protein enriched in charged residues. Microarray analysis identified 372 genes with a 10-fold or greater difference in transcript levels between elytra and hindwings. CP genes with higher expression in the elytra belonged to the Rebers and Riddiford family (CPR) type 2, or cuticular proteins of low complexity (CPLC) enriched in glycine or proline. In contrast, a majority of the CP genes with higher expression in hindwings were classified as CPR type 1, cuticular proteins analogous to peritrophins (CPAP), or members of the Tweedle family. This research shows that the elyra and hindwings, representatives of rigid and soft cuticles, have different protein and gene expression profiles for structural proteins that may influence the mechanical properties of these cuticles.

TI Intestinal tissue engineering: current concepts and future vision of
   regenerative medicine in the gut
SO NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY
AB Background and Purpose Functional tissue engineering of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a complex process aiming to aid the regeneration of structural layers of smooth muscle, intrinsic enteric neuronal plexuses, specialized mucosa, and epithelial cells as well as interstitial cells. The final tissue-engineered construct is intended to mimic the native GI tract anatomically and physiologically. Physiological functionality of tissue-engineered constructs is of utmost importance while considering clinical translation. The construct comprises of cellular components as well as biomaterial scaffolding components. Together, these determine the immune response a tissue-engineered construct would elicit from a host upon implantation. Over the last decade, significant advances have been made to mitigate adverse host reactions. These include a quest for identifying autologous cell sources like embryonic and adult stem cells, bone marrow-derived cells, neural crest-derived cells, and muscle derived-stem cells. Scaffolding biomaterials have been fabricated with increasing biocompatibility and biodegradability. Manufacturing processes have advanced to allow for precise spatial architecture of scaffolds to mimic in vivo milieu closely and achieve neovascularization. This review will focus on the current concepts and the future vision of functional tissue engineering of the diverse neuromuscular structures of the GI tract from the esophagus to the internal anal sphincter.

TI Biomechanical and Morphological Differences between the Sclera Canal
   Ring and a Peripheral Sclera Ring in the Porcine Eye
SO OPHTHALMIC RESEARCH
AB Aim: To investigate a possible association between the biomechanical load and unload behaviour and the elastin content of the sclera canal ring (SCR) and a superiorly localized sclera ring (SPS) in the porcine eye. Methods: Two sclera rings were trephined from each of 40 porcine eyes, one containing the SCR and the other an SPS. The load and the unload curves were measured in the extension range of 0-2.0 mm by a biomaterial tester. Hysteresis was determined from the area enclosed by the loading and unloading curve. Histochemical staining with resorcin-fuchsin and morphometric analysis of paraffin-embedded sections of both rings were performed to detect the area occupied by elastin fibres. Results: At 1 mm extension, the mean load of the SCR was 0.89 +/- 0.22 N and that of the SPS 1.13 +/- 0.19 N, which was not significantly different between both rings (p > 0.05). Mean hysteresis in the SCR was 1.55 +/- 0.30 N x mm and 1.90 +/- 0.18 N x mm in the SPS, which was significantly different between both rings (p = 0.01). Mean sclera thickness was 986 mu m in the SCR (range: 900-1,060 mu m) and 971 mu m in the SPS (range: 800-1,200 mu m) without a statistically significant difference between both sclera rings (p = 0.78). The area occupied by elastin fibres was 15.5 +/- 3.4% in the SCR and 4.5 +/- 1.5% in the SPS, which was significantly different between both rings (p = 0.0001). Conclusion: Hysteresis in the SCR was significantly lower than in the SPS, indicating a higher elasticity of the SCR in the porcine eye. This effect could be explained by a higher content of elastin in the surrounding ring of the peripapillary optic nerve head providing reversible contraction in cases of intra-ocular pressure variations.

TI Physical characterization of poly(glycerol sebacate)/Bioglass (R)
   composites
SO POLYMER INTERNATIONAL
AB Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and X-ray diffraction have been used to characterize the structure of a crosslinked polyester (poly(glycerol sebacate), PGS), prepared from a molar ratio of a diacid (sebacic acid) and a triol (glycerol), and their composites formed with an alkaline reactive filler, Bioglass (R). The Bioglass reacts with the sebacic acid carboxylate groups during the composite synthesis, resulting in elastomers that are linked by ionic and covalent crosslinks. Due to its relatively low crosslink density, the unfilled PGS polymer can crystallize below room temperature but is an amorphous elastomer at room temperature. The DSC results show that the Bioglass composites are also semicrystalline below room temperature but the crystallinity is disrupted by the ionic linkages. DMTA of the dry PGS and PGS-Bioglass composites confirms the semicrystalline nature of the materials and comparison with specimens that had been saturated with water vapour shows that the ionic crosslinks are dissociated by hydration by water molecules.

TI In Vitro Cartilage Tissue Engineering Using Adipose-Derived
   Extracellular Matrix Scaffolds Seeded with Adipose-Derived Stem Cells
SO TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A
AB Extracellular matrix (ECM) secreted from the resident cell of tissue is an ideal biomaterial evolved by nature. Cartilage is also built from well-organized ECM components in a gel-like structure with a high collagen and proteoglycan content. Here, we explored cartilage tissue engineering using ECM scaffolds seeded with stem cells. Both scaffolds and stem cells were isolated from human adipose tissue, which is abundant and easily harvested in the human body. The human ECM scaffolds contained various endogenous bioactive factors, including transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta 1, 8782 +/- 4989 pg/g, dry ECM), insulin growth factor-1 (13319 +/- 1388 pg/g, dry ECM), basic fibroblast growth factor (82373 +/- 9572 pg/g, dry ECM), and vascular endothelial growth factor (25647 +/- 2749 pg/g, dry ECM). A composite of ECM and stem cells was prepared and cultured in chondrogenic medium (with 10 ng/mL TGF-beta 1 or not) for 45 days. The volumes and weights of the composites increased during culture and the surface gradually became smooth. Cell viability remained high throughout the 45 days of in vitro culture. Composites showed the formation of cartilage-like tissue with the synthesis of cartilage-specific proteins such as collagen and glycosaminoglycan. Important chondrogenic markers were expressed including Sox-9, aggrecan, and collagen type II and XI. These results demonstrate that a cell/ECM composite containing endogenous bioactive factors could provide biochemical cues for the promotion of cartilage formation.

TI Substrate Three-Dimensionality Induces Elemental Morphological
   Transformation of Sensory Neurons on a Physiologic Timescale
SO TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A
AB The natural environment of a neuron is the three-dimensional (3D) tissue. In vivo, embryonic sensory neurons transiently express a bipolar morphology with two opposing neurites before undergoing cytoplasmic and cytoskeletal rearrangement to a more mature pseudo-unipolar axonal arbor before birth. The unipolar morphology is crucial in the adult for correct information transmission from the periphery to the central nervous system. On two-dimensional (2D) substrates this transformation is delayed significantly or absent. We report that a 3D culture platform can invoke the characteristic transformation to the unipolar axonal arbor within a time frame similar to in vivo, overcoming the loss of this essential milestone in 2D substrates. Additionally, 3D substrates alone provided an environment that promoted axonal branching features that reflect morphological patterns observed in vivo. We have also analyzed the involvement of soluble cues in these morphogenic processes by culturing the neurons in the presence and absence of nerve growth factor (NGF), a molecule that plays distinct roles in the development of the peripheral and central nervous systems. Without NGF, both 2D and 3D cultures had significant decreases in the relative population of unipolar neurons as well as shorter neurite lengths and fewer branch points compared to cultures with NGF. Interestingly, branching features of neurons cultured in 3D without NGF resemble those of neurons cultured in 2D with NGF. Therefore, neurons cultured in 3D without NGF lost the ability to differentiate into unipolar neurons, suggesting that this morphological hallmark requires not only presentation of soluble cues like NGF, but also the surrounding 3D presentation of adhesive ligands to allow for realization of the innate morphogenic program. We propose that in a 3D environment, various matrix and soluble cues are presented toward all surfaces of the cell; this optimized milieu allows neurons to elaborate their genuine phenotype and follow programmed instructions that are intrinsic to the neuron, but disrupted when cells were dissected from the embryo. Thus, this study presents quantitative data supporting that 3D substrates are critical for sustaining the in vivo ontogeny of neurons and deciphering signaling mechanisms necessary for designing biomaterial scaffolds for nerve generation and repair.

TI The effect of processing variables on morphological and mechanical
   properties of supercritical CO2 foamed scaffolds for tissue engineering
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB The porous structure of a scaffold determines the ability of bone to regenerate within this environment. In situations where the scaffold is required to provide mechanical function, balance must be achieved between optimizing porosity and maximizing mechanical strength. Supercritical CO2 foaming can produce open-cell, interconnected structures in a low-temperature, solvent-free process. In this work, we report on foams of varying structural and mechanical properties fabricated from different molecular weights of poly(DL-lactic acid) P(DL)LA (57,25 and 15 kDa) and by varying the depressurization rate. Rapid depressurization rates produced scaffolds with homogeneous pore distributions and some closed pores. Decreasing the depressurization rate produced scaffolds with wider pore size distributions and larger, more interconnected pores. In compressive testing, scaffolds produced from 57 kDa P(DL)LA exhibited typical stress-strain curves for elastomeric open-cell foams whereas scaffolds fabricated from 25 and 15 kDa P,LA behaved as brittle foams. The structural and mechanical properties of scaffolds produced from 57 kDa P(DL)LA by scCO(2) ensure that these scaffolds are suitable for potential applications in bone tissue engineering.

TI Submicron-textured biomaterial surface reduces staphylococcal bacterial
   adhesion and biofilm formation
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB Staphylococci are among the most important pathogens causing bloodstream infections associated with implanted medical devices. Control of bacterial adhesion to material surfaces is important for prevention of biofilm formation and biomaterial-associated infections. In this study, we hypothesized that submicron (staphylococcal bacterial dimension) surface textures may reduce the bacterial adhesion via a decrease in surface area that bacteria can contact, and subsequently inhibit biofilm formation. Poly(urethane urea) films were textured with two different sizes of submicron pillars via a two-stage replication process. Adhesion of two bacterial strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A and S. aureus Newman) was assessed over a shear stress range of 0-13.2 dyn cm(-2) using a rotating disk system in physiological buffer solutions. Significant decreases in bacterial adhesion were observed on textured surfaces for both strains compared with smooth controls. Biofilm formation was further tested on surfaces incubated in solution for either 2 or 5 days and it was found that biofilm formation was dramatically inhibited on textured surfaces. The results of the approaches used in this work demonstrate that patterned surface texturing of biomaterials provides an effective means to reduce staphylococcal adhesion and biofilm formation on biomaterial surfaces, and thus to prevent biomaterial-associated infections.

TI Differences in protein binding and cytokine release from monocytes on
   commercially sourced tissue culture polystyrene
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB Tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) is a ubiquitous substrate used by many researchers in the biomedical and biological sciences. Different parameters involved in the production of TCPS, including the treatment time and the use of reactive gases and chemical agents, can have a significant influence on the ultimate surface properties achieved. The assumption that they will all yield a consistent and controlled product has not proven to be true. To provide a better insight into the bioactivity differences in TCPS supplied by different manufacturers, TCPS from three different companies (Sarstedt, Wisent Corp., and Becton Dickinson (BD)) were analyzed for their surface properties, protein adsorption characteristics, and interactions with human monocytes. Marked differences were observed in terms of surface wettability and surface chemistry. Furthermore, Wisent TCPS adsorbed more than twice the amount of serum proteins compared with BD and Sarstedt TCPS. Sarstedt showed significantly more cell retention (more DNA) compared with both BD and Wisent TCPS brands over a 7 day culture period. Cytokine release from monocytes adherent on the three different TCPS also differed significantly, suggesting that the differences in the surface properties were sufficient to differentially mediate monocyte activation. These results have important implications for TCPS research use, in terms of appreciating the interpretation of the data when TCPS is used as a control substrate as well as when it is used where a pre-conditioned state would influence the outcome of the study.

TI Mechanical property characterization of electrospun recombinant human
   tropoelastin for vascular graft biomaterials
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB The development of vascular grafts has focused on finding a biomaterial that is non-thrombogenic, minimizes intimal hyperplasia, matches the mechanical properties of native vessels and allows for regeneration of arterial tissue. In this study, the structural and mechanical properties and the vascular cell compatibility of electrospun recombinant human tropoelastin (rTE) were evaluated as a potential vascular graft support matrix. Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was used to cross-link electrospun rTE fibers to produce a polymeric recombinant tropoelastin (prTE) matrix that is stable in aqueous environments. Tubular 1 cm diameter prTE samples were constructed for uniaxial tensile testing and 4 mm small-diameter prTE tubular scaffolds were produced for burst pressure and cell compatibility evaluations from 15 wt.% rTE solutions. Uniaxial tensile tests demonstrated an average ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 0.36 +/- 0.05 MPa and elastic moduli of 0.15 +/- 0.04 and 0.91 +/- 0.16 MPa, which were comparable to extracted native elastin. Burst pressures of 485 +/- 25 mm Hg were obtained from 4 mm internal diameter scaffolds with 453 +/- 74 mu m average wall thickness. prTE supported endothelial cell growth with typical endothelial cell cobblestone morphology after 48 h in culture. Cross-linked electrospun rTE has promising properties for utilization as a vascular graft biomaterial with customizable dimensions, a compliant matrix and vascular cell compatibility.

TI Structure-property relationships of meta-kerateine biomaterials derived
   from human hair
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB The structure-property relationships of kerateine materials were studied by separating crude hair extracts into two protein sub-fractions, referred to as alpha- and gamma-kerateines, followed by their de novo recombination into meta-kerateine hydrogels, sponges and films. The kerateine fractions were characterized using electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, which revealed that the alpha-fraction contained complexes of type I and type II keratins and that the gamma-fraction was primarily protein fragments of the alpha-fraction along with three proteins of the KAP-1 family. Meta-kerateine materials with increased amounts of gamma-kerateines showed diminished physical, mechanical and biological characteristics. Most notably, materials with higher gamma-content formed less elastic and less solid-like hydrogels and sponges that were less hydrolytically stable. In addition, a model biological assay showed that meta-kerateine films with greater amounts of gamma-kerateines were less supportive of hepatocyte attachment. Investigation into the mechanism of attachment revealed that hepatocyte adhesion to meta-kerateines is not mediated by the pi integrin subunit, despite the presence of LDV binding motifs within the type I alpha-keratins. This work to define the role of protein composition on biomaterial function is essential for the optimization of keratin biomaterials for biomedical applications. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Compositional and microstructural design of highly bioactive
   P2O5-Na2O-CaO-SiO2 glass-ceramics
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB Bioactive glasses having chemical compositions between 1Na(2)O-2CaO-3SiO(2) (1N2C3S) and 1.5Na(2)O-1.5CaO-3SiO(2) (1N1C2S) containing 0, 4 and 6 wt.% P2O5 were crystallized through two stage thermal treatments. By carefully controlling these treatments we separately studied the effects on the mechanical properties of two important microstructural features not studied before, crystallized volume fraction and crystal size. Fracture strength, elastic modulus and indentation fracture toughness were measured as a function of crystallized volume fraction for a constant crystal size. Glass-ceramics with a crystalline volume fraction between 34% and 60% exhibited a three-fold improvement in fracture strength and an increase of 40% in indentation fracture toughness compared with the parent glass. For the optimal crystalline concentration (34% and 60%) these mechanical properties were then measured for different grain sizes, from 5 to 21 mu m. The glass-ceramic with the highest fracture strength and indentation fracture toughness was that with 34% crystallized volume fracture and 13 mu m crystals. Compared with the parent glass, the average fracture strength of this glass-ceramic was increased from 80 to 210 MPa, and the fracture toughness from 0.60 to 0.95 MPa.m(1/2). The increase in indentation fracture toughness was analyzed using different theoretical models, which demonstrated that it is due to crack deflection. Fortunately, the elastic modulus E increased only slightly: from 60 to 70 GPa (the elastic modulus of biomaterials should be as close as possible to that of cortical bone). In summary, the flexural strength of our best material (215 MPa) is significantly greater than that of cortical bone and comparable with that of apatite-wollastonite (A/W) bioglass ceramics, with the advantage that it shows a much lower elastic modulus. These results thus provide a relevant guide for the design of bioactive glass-ceramics with improved microstructure. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Efficient use of shrimp waste: present and future trends
SO APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB The production of shrimp waste from shrimp processing industries has undergone a dramatic increase in recent years. Continued production of this biomaterial without corresponding development of utilizing technology has resulted in waste collection, disposal, and pollution problems. Currently used chemical process releases toxic chemicals such as HCl, acetic acid, and NaOH into aquatic ecosystem as byproducts which will spoil the aquatic flora and fauna. Environmental protection regulations have become stricter. Now, there is a need to treat and utilize the waste in most efficient manner. The shrimp waste contains several bioactive compounds such as chitin, pigments, amino acids, and fatty acids. These bioactive compounds have a wide range of applications including medical, therapies, cosmetics, paper, pulp and textile industries, biotechnology, and food applications. This current review article present the utilization of shrimp waste as well as an alternative technology to replace hazardous chemical method that address the future trends in total utilization of shrimp waste for recovery of bioactive compounds.

TI Ultrastructure of regenerated bone mineral surrounding
   hydroxyapatite-alginate composite and sintered hydroxyapatite
SO BONE
AB We report the ultrastructure of regenerated bone surrounding two types of biomaterials: hydroxyapatite-alginate composite and sintered hydroxyapatite. Critical defects in the calvaria of Wistar rats were filled with micrometer-sized spherical biomaterials and analyzed after 90 and 120 days of implantation by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance microscopy, respectively. Infrared spectroscopy showed that hydroxyapatite of both biomaterials became more disordered after implantation in the rat calvaria, indicating that the biological environment induced modifications in biomaterials structure. We observed that the regenerated bone surrounding both biomaterials had a lamellar structure with type I collagen fibers alternating in adjacent lamella with angles of approximately 90 degrees. In each lamella, plate-like apatite crystals were aligned in the c-axis direction, although a rotation around the c-axis could be present. Bone plate-like crystal dimensions were similar in regenerated bone around biomaterials and pre-existing bone in the rat calvaria. No epitaxial growth was observed around any of the biomaterials. A distinct mineralized layer was observed between new bone and hydroxyapatite-alginate biomaterial. This region presented a particular ultrastructure with crystallites smaller than those of the bulk of the biomaterial, and was possibly formed during the synthesis of alginate-containing composite or in the biological environment after implantation. Round nanoparticles were observed in regions of newly formed bone. The findings of this work contribute to a better understanding of the role of hydroxyapatite based biomaterials in bone regeneration processes at the nanoscale. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

TI Sol-gel behavior of a novel nanodroplet biomaterial for drug delivery
SO JOURNAL OF SOL-GEL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Nanodroplets can be considered as those nano/microemulsions in which the oil itself forms the active agent and the droplet size ambits in the nanometer range. Eugenol is an anti-inflammatory agent and its nanodroplet gel (NDG) has immense potential for topical use. Topical gels oblige some rheological characteristics to nail down the demands of proper application, stability and storage. Thus, the purpose of our study was to comprehend the effect of eugenol on the sol-gel tranisition properties of its NDGs. Towards this goal nanodroplets of eugenol were prepared and evaluated and the three selected nanodroplet formulations with 5, 10 and 5% v/v eugenol were converted into topical gel formulation using 1% w/w Carbopol 940. The NDGs were characterized using frequency sweep, creep recovery and thixotropy. All these tests pointed out that eugenol concentration has significant effect on the sol-gel behavior of NDGs. The NDGs exhibited more viscous (sol) properties than elastic (gel) properties as observed from the frequency sweep studies. The thixotropy of the NDGs was found to decrease with increase in eugenol concentration. Efforts have been made to explain the study results using mechanistic approach. The outcomes of our research studies could be of great use in future endeavors towards development of a topical NDG of eugenol with tailored sol-gel behavior.

TI Fabrication and characterization of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)
   microsphere/amorphous calcium phosphate scaffolds
SO JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE
AB Although hydroxyapatite (HAP) and beta-tricalcium phosphate have been used extensively as osteoconductive minerals in biomaterial scaffolds for bone regeneration, they lack the capacity to stimulate osteoblastic differentiation of progenitor cells. In contrast, amorphous calcium phosphates (ACPs), which convert to HAP under aqueous conditions, have the potential to facilitate osteoblastic differentiation through the transient local release of calcium and phosphate ions. Therefore, in this study ACPs were synthesized using zinc and zirconia divalent cations as stabilizers (denoted ZnACP and ZrACP, respectively) and compared to HAP. Analysis of ion release into serum-containing cell culture medium revealed transiently elevated levels of calcium and phosphorous, consistent with the enhanced solubility of ZrACP and ZnACP relative to HAP. In addition, X-ray diffraction analysis revealed partial conversion of ZrACP to HAP but no conversion of ZnACP after 96 h. Next, scaffolds were fabricated by sintering mixtures of 300500 mu m poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres and 0.5 wt% calcium phosphate mineral (HAP, ZrACP or ZnACP) at 70 degrees C for 24 h. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a porous microsphere matrix with calcium phosphate particulates clinging to the microsphere surfaces both prior to and after 14 days in culture medium. Finally, the incorporation of calcium phosphate resulted in a lower compressive modulus in the range 127 to 7489 MPa. Taken together, these results indicate that ZrACP, ZnACP and HAP minerals exhibit very different properties, and therefore may elicit different osteoblastic responses in vitro.

TI Oxygen diffusion through collagen scaffolds at defined densities:
   implications for cell survival in tissue models
SO JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE
AB For the success of any biomaterial for tissue engineering, its mechanical properties and ability to support nutrient diffusion will be critical. Collagen scaffolds are ideal candidates, due to their ability to immerse cells in a biomimetic nanofibrous matrix. We have established O2 diffusion coefficients through native, dense collagen scaffolds at two tissue-like densities, with and without photo-chemical crosslinking, by adapting an optical fibre-based system for real-time core O2 monitoring deep within collagen constructs. Using a Fick's law model, we then derived O2 diffusion coefficients; 4.5 x 10(-6) cm2/s for 11% density collagen scaffolds; 1.7 x 10(-6) cm2/s for 34% collagen scaffolds; 3.4 x 10(-6) cm2/s for photochemically crosslinked collagen scaffolds at 11%. Both O2 diffusion coefficients of the 11% collagen fall within the range of native intestinal submucosa. The high diffusion coefficients of these collagen scaffolds, as well as their material properties, render them viable tissue-engineering matrices for tissue replacement.

TI Adhesive Bond Stiffness of Staphylococcus aureus with and without
   Proteins That Bind to an Adsorbed Fibronectin Film
SO APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Staphylococcus aureus is known to cause biomaterial-associated infections of implants and devices once it has breached the skin and mucosal barriers. Adhesion is the initial step in the development of a biomaterial-associated infection, and strategies to prevent staphylococcal adhesion and thus biomaterial-associated infections require understanding of the adhesive bond. The aim of this study was to compare the adhesive bond stiffnesses of two S. aureus strains with and without fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs) adhering to a fibronectin-coated quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor surface on the basis of a coupled- resonance model. Both fibronectin adsorption and staphylococcal adhesion were accompanied by negative frequency shifts, regardless of the absence or presence of FnBPs on the staphylococcal cell surfaces. This is the opposite of the positive frequency shifts often observed for other bacterial strains adhering to bare sensor surfaces. Most likely, adhering staphylococci sink into and deform the adsorbed protein layer, creating stiff binding with the sensor surface due to an increased bacterium-substratum contact area. S. aureus 8325-4 possesses FnBPs and yields less negative frequency shifts (Delta f) that are further away from the zero-crossing frequency than S. aureus DU5883. This suggests that FnBPs on S. aureus 8325-4 create a stiffer bond to the fibronectin coating than has been observed for S. aureus DU5883. Due to a limited window of observation, as defined by the available resonance frequencies in QCM, we could not determine exact stiffness values.

TI Urokinase Receptor Associates With Myocardin to Control Vascular Smooth
   Muscle Cells Phenotype in Vascular Disease
SO ARTERIOSCLEROSIS THROMBOSIS AND VASCULAR BIOLOGY
AB Objective-The urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its specific receptor (uPAR) are a potent multifunctional system involved in vascular remodeling. The goal of the study was to unravel the mechanisms of uPA/uPAR-directed vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation.
   Methods and Results-Using cultured human primary VSMCs, we identified a new molecular mechanism controlling phenotypic modulation in vitro and in vivo. We found that the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) acts together with the transcriptional coactivator myocardin to regulate the VSMC phenotype. uPAR, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell-surface receptor family member, undergoes ligand-induced internalization and nuclear transport in VSMCs. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta and SUMOylated RanGAP1 mediate this trafficking. Nuclear uPAR associates with myocardin, which is then recruited from the promoters of serum response factor target genes and undergoes proteasomal degradation. This chain of events initiates the synthetic VSMC phenotype. Using mouse carotid artery ligation model, we show that this mechanism contributes to adverse vascular remodeling after injury in vivo. We then cultured cells on a microstructured biomaterial and found that substrate topography induced uPAR-mediated VSMC differentiation.
   Conclusion-These findings reveal the transcriptional activity of uPAR, controlling the differentiation of VSMCs in a vascular disease model. They also suggest a new role for uPAR as a therapeutic target and as a marker for VSMC phenotyping on prosthetic biomaterials. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2012;32:110-122.)

TI The use of quaternised chitosan-loaded PMMA to inhibit biofilm formation
   and downregulate the virulence-associated gene expression of
   antibiotic-resistant staphylococcus
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Biomaterial-associated infections remain a serious complication in orthopaedic surgery. Treatments, including the local use of antibiotic-loaded polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement, are not always successful because of multiantibiotic-resistant organisms. In this study, we synthesised a new quaternised chitosan derivative (hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan, HACC) that contains a series of substitutions of quaternary ammonium and demonstrated that HACC with a 26% degree of substitution (DS; referred to as 26%HACC) had a strong antibacterial activity and simultaneously good biocompatibility with osteogenic cells. We loaded 26%HACC at 20% by weight into PMMA bone cement to investigate whether HACC in PMMA prevents bacterial biofilm formation on the surface of bone cements. Chitosan-loaded PMMA (at the same weight ratio), gentamicin-loaded PMMA and PMMA with no antibiotic were also investigated and compared. Two clinical isolates, Staphylococcus epidermidis 389 and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE287), and two standard strains, S. epidermidis (ATCC35984) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC43300), were selected to evaluate the bacterial biofilm formation at 6,12 and 24 h using the spread plate method, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that 26% HACC-loaded PMMA inhibited biofilm formation on its surface, while the PMMA control and chitosan-loaded PMMA were unable to inhibit biofilm formation. The gentamicin-loaded PMMA decreased the number of viable methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus strains, but its ability to inhibit biofilm formation was lower than 26%HACC-loaded PMMA. Real-time PCR demonstrated that 26%HACC-loaded PMMA markedly downregulated the expression of icaAD, which encodes essential enzymes for polysaccharide intercellular adhesion (PIA) biosynthesis, upregulated the expression level of icaR, which negatively mediates icaAD expression, and also downregulated the expression of MecA, which encodes membrane-bound enzymes known to be penicillin-binding proteins. Our study indicates that 26%HACC-loaded PMMA prevents biofilm formation of Staphylococcus, including antibiotic-resistant strains, on the surface of bone cement, and downregulates the virulence-associated gene expression of antibiotic-resistant staphylococcus, thus providing a promising new strategy for combating implant infections and osteomyelitis.

TI Engineering of adult human neural stem cells differentiation through
   surface micropatterning
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Interaction between differentiating neural stem cells and the extracellular environment guides the establishment of cell polarity during nervous system development. Developing neurons read the physical properties of the local substrate in a contact-dependent manner and retrieve essential guidance cues. To restore damage brain area by tissue engineering, the biomaterial scaffold has to mimic this microenvironment to allow organized tissue regeneration. To establish the validity of using microgrooved surfaces in order to simultaneously provide to primary adult human neural stem cells a permissive growth environment and a guide for neurite outgrowth in a pre-established direction, we have studied the long-term culture of adult human neural stem cells from patient biopsies on microgrooved polymers. By exploiting polymer moulding techniques, we engineered non-cytotoxic deep microstructured surfaces of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) exhibiting microchannels of various widths. Our results demonstrate that precoated micropatterned PDMS surfaces can serve as effective neurite guidance surfaces for human neural stem cells. Immunocytochemistry analysis show that channel width can impact strongly development and differentiation. In particular we found an optimal microchannel width, that conciliates a high differentiation rate with a pronounced alignment of neurites along the edges of the microchannels. The impact of the microstructures on neurite orientation turned out to be strongly influenced by cell density, attesting that cell/surface interactions at the origin of the alignment effect, are in competition with cell/cell interactions tending to promote interconnected networks of cells. Considering all these effects, we have been able to design appropriate structures allowing to obtain neuron development and differentiation rate comparable to a plane unpatterned surface, with an efficient neurite guidance and a long-term cell viability.

TI Chondrogenesis of hMSC in affinity-bound TGF-beta scaffolds
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Herein we describe a bio-inspired, affinity binding alginate-sulfate scaffold, designed for the presentation and sustained release of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), and examine its effects on the chondrogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). When attached to matrix via affinity interactions with alginate sulfate, TGF-beta 1 loading was significantly greater and its initial release from the scaffold was attenuated compared to its burst release (>90%) from scaffolds lacking alginate-sulfate. The sustained TGF-beta 1 release was further supported by the prolonged activation (14 d) of Smad-dependent (Smad2) and Smad-independent (ERK1/2) signaling pathways in the seeded hMSCs. Such presentation of TGF-beta 1 led to hMSC chondrogenic differentiation; differentiated chondrocytes with deposited collagen type II were seen within three weeks of in vitro hMSC seeding. By contrast, in scaffolds lacking alginate-sulfate, the effect of TGF-beta 1 was short-term and hMSCs could not reach a similar differentiation degree. When hMSC constructs were subcutaneously implanted in nude mice, chondrocytes with deposited type II collagen and aggrecan typical of the articular cartilage were found in the TGF-beta 1 affinity-bound constructs. Our results highlight the fundamental importance of appropriate factor presentation to its biological activity, namely - inducing efficient stem cell differentiation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Neural cell type-specific responses to glycomimetic functionalized
   collagen
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Despite their noted functional role, glycans have had limited therapeutic use due to difficulties in synthesis and quick degradation in vivo. The recent discovery of glycomimetics has provided new opportunities for their application. In this study, we have functionalized type I collagen with peptide mimics of two glycans: (1) polysialic acid (PSA) and (2) an epitope first discovered on human natural killer cells (HNK-1). These glycans and their glycomimetic counterparts have been shown to be important regulators of repair following injury through their unique and phenotypically specific effects on neural behavior. We show that these molecules retain their bioactivity following functionalization to the collagen backbone. Grafted HNK-1 encouraged motor neuron outgrowth, while grafted PSA encouraged sensory and motor neuron outgrowth and enhanced Schwann cell proliferation and process extension. These data support the potential of glycomimetic-functionalized collagen as a biomaterial strategy to increase the efficiency of synaptic reconnection following nervous system injury.

TI Precipitation of nanohydroxyapatite on PLIA/PBLG/Collagen nanofibrous
   structures for the differentiation of adipose derived stem cells to
   osteogenic lineage
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Tissue engineering and nanotechnology have enabled engineering of nanostructured materials to meet the current challenges in bone treatment owing to rising occurrence of bone diseases, accidental damages and defects. Poly(L-lactic acid)/Poly-benzyl-L-glutamate/Collagen (PLLA/PBLG/Col) scaffolds were fabricated by electrospinning and nanohydroxyapatite (n-HA) was deposited by calcium-phosphate dipping method for bone tissue engineering (BTE). The abundance and accessibility of adipose derived stem cells (ADSC) may prove to be novel cell therapeutics for bone repair and regeneration. ADSCs were cultured on these scaffolds and were induced to undergo osteogenic differentiation in the presence of PBLG/n-HA for BTE. The cell-biomaterial interactions were analyzed using cell proliferation, SEM and CMFDA dye extraction techniques. Osteogenic differentiation of ADSC was confirmed using alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), mineralization (ARS) and dual immunofluorescent staining using both ADSC marker protein and Osteocalcin, which is a bone specific protein. The utmost significance of this study is the bioactive PBLG/n-HA biomolecule introduced on the polymeric nanofibers to regulate and improve specific biological functions like adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of ADSC into osteogenic lineage. This was evident from the immunostaining and CMFDA images of ADSCs showing cuboidal morphology, characteristic of osteogenic lineage. The observed results proved that the PLLA/PBLG/Col/n-HA scaffolds promoted greater osteogenic differentiation of ADSC as evident from the enzyme activity and mineralization profiles for bone tissue engineering.

TI The use of chemokine-releasing tissue engineering scaffolds in a model
   of inflammatory response-mediated melanoma cancer metastasis
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Inflammatory responses and associated products have been implicated in cancer metastasis. However, the relationship between these two processes is uncertain due to the lack of a suitable model. Taking advantage of localized and controllable inflammatory responses induced by biomaterial implantation and the capability of tissue scaffolds to release a wide variety of chemokines, we report a novel system for studying the molecular mechanisms of inflammation-mediated cancer metastasis. The animal model is comprised of an initial subcutaneous implantation of biomaterial microspheres which prompt localized inflammatory responses, followed by the transplantation of metastatic cancer cells into the peritoneal cavity or blood circulation. Histological results demonstrated that substantial numbers of B16F10 cells were recruited to the site nearby biomaterial implants. There was a strong correlation between the degree of biomaterial-mediated inflammatory responses and number of recruited cancer cells. Inflammation-mediated cancer cell migration was inhibited by small molecule inhibitors of CXCR4 but not by neutralizing antibody against CCL21. Using chemokine-releasing scaffolds, further studies were carried out to explore the possibility of enhancing cancer cell recruitment. Interestingly, erythropoietin (EPO) releasing scaffolds, but not stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha-releasing scaffolds, were found to accumulate substantially more melanoma cells than controls. Rather unexpectedly, perhaps by indirectly reducing circulating cancer cells, mice implanted with EPO-releasing scaffolds had similar to 30% longer life span than other groups. These results suggest that chemokine-releasing scaffolds may potentially function as implantable cancer traps and serve as powerful tools for studying cancer distraction and even selective annihilation of circulating metastatic cancer cells.

TI Synthetic Matrices to Serve as Niches for Muscle Cell Transplantation
SO CELLS TISSUES ORGANS
AB Poor cell retention and limited cell survival after grafting are major limitations of cell therapy. Recent studies showed that the use of matrices as vehicles at the time of cell injection can significantly improve cell engraftment by providing an appropriate structure and physical support for the injected cells. Properly designed matrices can also promote the organization of the cells into a functioning cardiac-like tissue and enhance integration between the host and the engrafted tissue. Furthermore, the use of an injectable biomaterial provides an opportunity to release in situ bioactive molecules that can further enhance the beneficial effects of cell transplantation. In this article we review a large variety of biologically derived synthetic and hybrid materials that have been tested as matrices for cardiac repair. We summarize the optimal parameters required for an ideal matrix including biocompatibility, injectability, degradation rate, and mechanical properties. Using an in vivo subcutaneous grafting model, we also provide novel data involving a side-by-side comparison of six synthetic matrices derived from maltodextrin. By systematically varying polymer molecular weight, cross-link density, and availability of cell adhesion motifs, a synthetic matrix was identified that supported skeletal myotube formation similar to Matrigel (TM). Our results emphasize not only the need to have a range of tunable matrices for cardiac cell therapy but also the importance of further characterizing the physical properties required for an ideal injectable matrix.

However, as diameters decrease below 6 mm, these grafts are clearly outperformed by transposed autologous veins and, particularly, arteries. With approximately 8 million individuals with peripheral arterial disease, over 500,000 patients diagnosed with end-stage renal disease, and over 250,000 patients per year undergoing coronary bypass in the USA alone, there is a critical clinical need for a functional small-diameter conduit [Lloyd-Jones et al., Circulation 2010; 121:e46-e215]. Over the last decade, we have witnessed a dramatic paradigm shift in cardiovascular tissue engineering that has driven the field away from biomaterial-focused approaches and towards more biology-driven strategies. In this article, we review the preclinical and clinical efforts in the quest for a tissue-engineered blood vessel that is free of permanent synthetic scaffolds but has the mechanical strength to become a successful arterial graft. Special emphasis is given to the tissue engineering by self-assembly (TESA) approach, which has been the only one to reach clinical trials for applications under arterial pressure.

TI Rapid synthesis of thermally stable hydroxyapaptite
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB We have optimized the wet precipitation synthesis of hydroxyapaptite to obtain thermally stable powder in the short time span of 3 min. Exposure of the reaction mixture to 1000 W microwave for 3 min furnished hydroxyapatite, which was thermally stable at temperatures up to 1200 degrees C. Powders were analyzed for phase purity using X-ray crystallography; chemical composition was studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy while particle morphology was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy.

TI Histological evaluation of healing after transalveolar maxillary sinus
   augmentation with bioglass and autogenous bone
SO CLINICAL ORAL IMPLANTS RESEARCH
AB Objectives: The aim was to evaluate histologically the outcome of a bioglass and autogenous bone (at 1 : 1 ratio) composite implantation for transalveolar sinus augmentation. Methods: In 31 patients, during implant installation ca. 4 months after sinus augmentation, biopsies were harvested through the transalveolar osteotomy by means of a trephine bur and non-decalcified sections through the long axis of the cylinder were produced. After a strict selection process, taking into account the presurgical residual bone height and biopsy length, 8 and 15 biopsies representing the new tissues formed inside the sinus and the transalveolar osteotomy, respectively, qualified for analysis. The tissue fractions occupied by newly formed bone (mineralized tissue_bone marrow), soft connective tissue, residual biomaterial_empty spaces, and debris inside the sinus cavity or the transalveolar osteotomy were estimated. Results: Bone and connective tissue fraction in the newly formed tissues inside the sinus cavity averaged 23.4 +/- 13.2% and 54.1 +/- 23.5%, respectively. Residual biomaterial, empty spaces, and debris averaged 1.9 +/- 3.5%, 10.5 +/- 6.3%, and 8.4 +/- 14.5%, respectively. In the transalveolar osteotomy, bone and connective tissue fraction averaged 41.6 +/- 14.3% and 46.1 +/- 13%, respectively, while the amount of residual biomaterial, empty spaces, and debris was 2.8 +/- 5%, 4.7 +/- 1.9%, and 3.2 +/- 2.6%, respectively. Statistically significant differences between the sinus cavity and the transalveolar osteotomy were found only for bone and empty spaces' values (P = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). Conclusion: Sinus augmentation with a bioglass and autogenous bone composite is compatible with bone formation that, in a short distance from the floor of the sinus, shows similar density as that reported previously for other commonly used bone substitutes. New bone fraction inside the transalveolar osteotomy was almost twice as much as in the sinus cavity, while the amount of residual biomaterial was much less than that inside the sinus.

TI The use of controlled surface topography and flow-induced shear stress
   to influence renal epithelial cell function
SO INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY
AB Physiologically-representative and well-controlled in vitro models of human tissue provide a means to safely, accurately, and rapidly develop therapies for disease. Current in vitro models do not possess appropriate levels of cell function, resulting in an inaccurate representation of in vivo physiology. Mechanical parameters, such as sub-micron topography and flow-induced shear stress (FSS), influence cell functions such as alignment, migration, differentiation and phenotypic expression. Combining, and independently controlling, biomaterial surface topography and FSS in a cell culture device would provide a means to control cell function resulting in more physiologically-representative in vitro models of human tissue. Here we develop the Microscale Tissue Modeling Device (MTMD) which couples a topographically-patterned substrate with a microfluidic chamber to control both topographic and FSS cues to cells. Cells from the human renal proximal tubule cell line HK-2 were cultured in the MTMD and exposed to topographic patterns and several levels of FSS simultaneously. Results show that the biomaterial property of surface topography and FSS work in concert to elicit cell alignment and influence tight junction (TJ) formation, with topography enhancing cell response to FSS. By administering independently-controlled mechanical parameters to cell populations, the MTMD creates a more realistic in vitro model of human renal tissue.

TI Investigation of Platelet Responses and Clotting Characteristics of in
   situ Albumin Binding Surfaces
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS APPLICATIONS
AB The response of biomaterial surfaces when exposed to blood is in part dependent upon the nature and composition of the adsorbed layer of proteins. Surfaces passivated with albumin have been shown to reduce platelet adhesion and activation. In an attempt to develop surfaces that can selectively and specifically bind albumin, silicon-based surfaces were functionalized with linear peptides and chemical ligands that displayed an affinity for albumin. Peptide functionalized surfaces were observed to preferentially bind albumin when compared to human immunoglobulin and human fibrinogen, which possess low densities of surface adsorbed platelets. The platelet morphology was noted to be discoid on the peptide modified surface. Both the unmodified control and SCL functionalized surfaces had high densities of surface adhered platelets with spread out morphology. The peptide and SCL functionalized surfaces were noted to have no impact on PTT and PT clotting times, indicating that the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways were unperturbed by the surfaces generated.

TI Improvement of the Cell-loading Efficiency of Biomaterials by
   Inoculation with Stem Cell-based Microspheres, in Osteogenesis
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS APPLICATIONS
AB In critical-size bone defects, autologous or allogenic cells are required in addition to compatible biomaterials for the successful defect healing. State of the art inoculation methods of biomaterials are based on the application of cell suspensions to the biomaterial. However, only less amounts of cells can be applied and sufficient adhesion to the material is required. Therefore, it was investigated whether the advantages of stem cell-based microspheres and insoluble collagenous bone matrix (ICBM) scaffolds can be combined which can lead to an advancement in cell seeding on biomaterials. Microspheres were produced from unrestricted somatic stem cells from human umbilical cord blood and were mounted on ICBM scaffolds. Following the incubation with osteogenic or control medium, the constructs were analyzed histologically after 3, 7, 14, and 28 days. Alizarin Red S and von Kossa staining revealed microsphere mineralization after 3 days in osteogenic and after 14 days in control medium. Meanwhile, a time-dependent increase in tissue, growing out of the microspheres, was detected. Our results provide evidence that microsphere-ICBM constructs are promising candidates for approaches of bone regeneration. They allow the transfer of substantially high numbers of cells in partially mineralized constructs.

TI A simplified in vivo approach for evaluating the bioabsorbable behavior
   of candidate stent materials
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS
AB Metal stents are commonly used to revascularize occluded arteries. A bioabsorbable metal stent that harmlessly erodes away over time may minimize the normal chronic risks associated with permanent implants. However, there is no simple, low-cost method of introducing candidate materials into the arterial environment. Here, we developed a novel experimental model where a biomaterial wire is implanted into a rat artery lumen (simulating bioabsorbable stent blood contact) or artery wall (simulating bioabsorbable stent matrix contact). We use this model to clarify the corrosion mechanism of iron (=99.5 wt %), which is a candidate bioabsorbable stent material due to its biocompatibility and mechanical strength. We found that iron wire encapsulation within the arterial wall extracellular matrix resulted in substantial biocorrosion by 22 days, with a voluminous corrosion product retained within the vessel wall at 9 months. In contrast, the blood-contacting luminal implant experienced minimal biocorrosion at 9 months. The importance of arterial blood versus arterial wall contact for regulating biocorrosion was confirmed with magnesium wires. We found that magnesium was highly corroded when placed in the arterial wall but was not corroded when exposed to blood in the arterial lumen for 3 weeks. The results demonstrate the capability of the vascular implantation model to conduct rapid in vivo assessments of vascular biomaterial corrosion behavior and to predict long-term biocorrosion behavior from material analyses. The results also highlight the critical role of the arterial environment (blood vs. matrix contact) in directing the corrosion behavior of biodegradable metals. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Biomaterial testing for covered stent membranes: Evaluating thrombosis
   and restenosis potential
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS
AB Covered stents may be able to prevent both thrombosis and restenosis, but new mechanically suitable and biocompatible materials are needed before this treatment option can become a reality. Hydrophilic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) cryogels have desirable mechanical properties for covered stent membranes and may be able to provide a physical barrier to restenosis with low thrombogenicity. An in vitro flow loop with porcine blood was used to compare thrombus formation on different blood-contacting biomaterials. PVA cryogels were found to maintain blood flow with low thrombogenicity and were significantly less thrombogenic than polyester (p < 0.05). The ability to prevent hyperplasic in-growth was evaluated using a modified Boyden chamber cellular migration assay. PVA cryogel membranes used as a physical barrier were found to nearly eliminate cellular migration (p < 0.05) without cellular toxicity. Overall, this article demonstrates pivotal feasibility results for a covered stent membrane material that could prevent restenosis by means of a hydrogel barrier with low thrombogenicity.

TI Design and assessment of a wrapped cylindrical Ca-P AZ31 Mg alloy for
   critical-size ulna defect repair
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS
AB Recently, magnesium has been investigated as a promising bioresorbable orthopedic biomaterial. Its mechanical properties are very similar to natural bone, making it appropriate for load-bearing orthopedic fracture repair applications. However, significant hurdles remain regarding the design of practical implants and methods to control degradation and enhance biocompatibility. Although attempts have been made to hinder magnesium's rapid corrosion via alloying and coating, these studies have used solid monoliths. In an effort to reduce the amount of alloy used for implantation in a shape that mimics cortical bone shape, this study used a thin sheet of Mg AZ31 which was rolled into hollow cylindrical scaffolds. The scaffold was coated with different amounts of Ca-P; this implant demonstrated slowed corrosion in simulated body fluid (SBF) as well as enhanced biocompatibility for mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). In vivo implantation of magnesium alloy scaffold adjacent to the rat femur showed significant biointegration with further deposition of complex Mg-Ca phosphates/carbonates typical of natural bone. Finally, the implant was placed in a critical-size ulna defect in live rabbits, which lead to radiographic union and partial restoration of biomechanical strength in the defect. This study demonstrated that a thin sheet of coated Mg alloy that was spirally wrapped wound be a promising orthopedic biomaterial for bone repair. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Standardized methods to quantify thrombogenicity of blood-contacting
   materials via thromboelastography
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS
AB Blood coagulation is the most significant complication of vascular biomaterials. A straightforward, sensitive, and standard measure of the compatibility of these materials with whole blood (hemocompatibility) is necessary to avoid coagulation. Current techniques used quantify only individual clotting components and are poor predictors of coagulation. The thromboelastograph (TEG) provides a measure of overall clot formation from whole blood. Although TEG is very common in clinical settings, its application to biomaterials is limited partly due to difficulty in sample preparation. In this protocol, whole blood samples are incubated with (1) biomaterials (tube with clamped ends) and (2) endothelial cells cultured on biomaterial surfaces (12-well plate) under controlled shearing conditions (10 rpm on rocker, at 37 degrees C), and then the blood is transferred to the TEG to measure clot formation. TEG clearly discriminates among the R-times (time until initial clot formation) of expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene), poly(urethane), and Tygon tubing. Marked differences in R-time are also seen when endothelial cells are cultured on various extracellular matrix proteins and proteoglycans. Thus, R-time provides a robust metric of overall thrombogenicity of biomaterials, and these procedures provide a standardized method for TEG to facilitate direct comparison among candidate biomaterials undergoing in-vitro testing.

TI Chondrocyte 3D-culture in RGD-modified crosslinked hydrogel with
   temperature-controllable modulus
SO MACROMOLECULAR RESEARCH
AB Based on the thermosensitivity of PluronicA (R) F127 and the cytointeractability of Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequences, RGD-modified F127 dimethacrylate (FM-RGD) hydrogel was investigated as a 3-dimensional culture matrix for chondrocytes. Chondrocytes were encapsulated in the hydrogel by radical copolymerization of FM-RGD and FM in the presence of cells. The FM-RGD hydrogel modulus could be modulated by temperature variation from 15 A degrees C (1,300 Pa) to the culture temperature of 37 A degrees C (8,900 Pa), at which the hydrogel provided a condrocyte-compatible microenvironment. Compared with the hydrogel prepared from F127 dimethacrylate (FM) without RGD, the RGD-modified hydrogel produced significant (p < 0.01) improvements in cell proliferation, DNA production, and viability while allowing the chondrocytes to maintain their original spherical phenotypes.

TI Physicochemical properties of soy protein isolate/carboxymethyl
   cellulose blend films crosslinked by Maillard reactions: Color,
   transparency and heat-sealing ability
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING C-MATERIALS FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB Soy protein isolate (SPI) films have many potential applications in the biomaterial field as surgical dressings for burns, films for reduction of wound inflammation, and facial masks. The appearance and the sealing ability are important physicochemical properties that greatly influence consumer acceptance of such protein-based films. The aim of the present work was to investigate the chemical structure and the physical properties associated with color, transparency and heat-sealing ability for SPI/carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) blend films prepared by solution casting, with weight proportions 90/10. 80/20, 70/30 and 60/40. Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) and solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra confirmed that Maillard reactions occurred between SPI and CMC. The Hunter color value (I., a, b) and transparency of films were affected by varying the proportions of SPI and CMC. With increasing degree of crosslinking of SPI and CMC, the yellow color of the films was diluted and transparency was improved. Peel strength and tensile strength measurements showed that the Maillard reactions had the main effect of enhancing the heat-sealing ability above the melting temperature. These results indicated that the structure and properties of SPI-based films could be modified and improved by blending with CMC. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Size-tunable nanoparticles composed of dextran-b-poly(D,L-lactide) for
   drug delivery applications
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB Nanoparticles (NPs) formulated using self-assembly of block copolymers have attracted significant attention as nano-scaled drug delivery vehicles. Here we report the development of a biodegradable NP using self-assembly of a linear amphiphilic block copolymer, Dex-b-PLA, composed of poly(D,L-lactide), and dextran. The size of the NPs can be precisely tuned between 15 and 70 nm by altering the molecular weight (M (W)) of the two polymer chains. Using doxorubicin as a model drug, we demonstrated that the NPs can carry up to 21% (w/w) of the drug payload. The release profile of doxorubicin from NPs showed sustained release for over 6 days. Using a rat model, we explored the pharmacokinetics profiles of Dex-b-PLA NPs, and showed proof-of-concept that long circulation lifetime of the NPs can be achieved by tuning the M (W) of Dex-b-PLA block copolymer. While the terminal half-life of Dex-b-PLA NPs (29.8 h) was similar to that observed in poly(ethylene glycol)-coated (PEG-coated) NPs (27.0 h), 90% of the injected Dex-b-PLA NPs were retained in the blood circulation for 38.3 h after injection, almost eight times longer than the PEG-coated NPs. The area under curve (AUC) of Dex-b-PLA NPs was almost four times higher than PEG-based NPs. The biodistribution study showed lower accumulation of Dex-b-PLA NPs in the spleen with 19.5% initial dose per gram tissue (IDGT) after 24 h compared to PEG-coated poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs (29.8% IDGT). These studies show that Dex-b-PLA block copolymer is a promising new biomaterial for making controlled nanoparticles as drug delivery vehicles.

TI Postimplant intraperitoneal behavior of collagen-based meshes followed
   by laparoscopy
SO SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
AB Background When repairing an abdominal wall defect, sometimes a prosthetic mesh needs to be placed directly on the parietal peritoneum. Although the standard mesh for this purpose is the laminar implant expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), it is gradually being replaced by the laminar collagen-based meshes. This study was designed to assess the intraperitoneal behavior of three of these biomeshes, mainly in terms of their susceptibility to adhesion formation.
   Methods Two 3-cm x 3-cm fragments of prosthetic material were placed on the parietal peritoneum in male New Zealand White rabbits in the following combinations: PTFE and CollaMend(A (R)), PTFE and Permacol(A (R)), or PTFE and Surgisis(A (R)). The meshes were fixed at the four corners with individual 4/0 polypropylene sutures. Adhesion formation was quantified by sequential laparoscopy and image analysis performed at 3, 7, 14, and 90 days postimplant. All animals were killed at 90 days and the mesh specimens were subjected to microscopy and immunohistochemistry.
   Results Intensely vascularized adhesions to all the implants were observed, although Surgisis showed the lowest percentage of adhesions at each follow-up time. Adhesions had stabilized by 7-14 days. The PTFE meshes were enveloped by a layer of macrophages and connective tissue, bounded by a monolayer of mesothelial cells. Permacol and CollaMend showed similar histological behavior, including cell ingrowth through their fenestrations with no signs of degradation detected at 90 days. In contrast, the Surgisis mesh at 90 days was practically replaced with neoformed tissue.
   Conclusions No difference in susceptibility to adhesion formation was noted in the crosslinked collagen meshes compared to PTFE meshes. The noncrosslinked collagen mesh Surgisis showed the best behavior in that it induced fewer adhesions. Ninety days after implant, a more intense macrophage response was observed in CollaMend and Permacol than in PTFE or Surgisis.

TI Modeling Filtration of Platelet-Rich Plasma in Fibrous Filters
SO TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA
AB Removing leukocytes (white cells) from blood products such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) prevents serious problems for the PRP recipients. We present a model to study selective separation of leukocytes from a dilute suspension of leukocytes and platelets (PRP) using fibrous filters. A selective PRP filter permits platelets to pass but bars the way for leukocytes. In PRP filters, fine synthetic fibers are packed randomly and interstices are larger than cells. Interactive forces between the suspended cells and fibers determine cell capture yield, i.e., deep-bed filtration process. Our model is based on a hierarchical set of differential equations corresponding to porescale and macroscale. At the porescale, we model movement and interaction of cells with fibers. A single cell entering the interstitial space encounters drag and surface forces. We define a unit bed element (UBE) composed of a fiber and interstitial space, where fiber diameter corrected for the size of the cells. We add measured surface forces between cells and fibers (electrostatic, van der Waals, fluid expression resistance, and biological responses) to the cell velocity equation. We then transform pore scale events into macroscale continuum by imposing periodic boundary conditions for contiguous UBEs and applying macrotransport theory. At macroscale, two independent coefficients: mean cell velocity vector U* and mean cell capture yield constant K*characterize cell filtration efficiency. Our model showed reasonable match with experimental data. Model results showed that diameter of fibers, injection velocity, bed porosity, and bed thickness control selective capture of leukocytes. Our model showed that it is merely impossible to filter out all leukocytes without capturing platelets. Based on our model, an optimized filter can capture 90% of leukocytes and pass through 45% of platelets.

TI Boron bioremoval by a newly isolated Chlorella sp and its stimulation by
   growth stimulators
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB It has been well documented that excess concentrations of boron (B) causes toxic effects on many of the environmental systems. Although Chlorella sp. has been studied to remove pollutants from water, its capacity to remove B has not been investigated yet. Boron removal levels of newly isolated Chlorella sp. were investigated in BG 11 media with stimulators as triacontanol (TRIA) and/or sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and without them, to test if they could increase the removal efficiency by increasing biomass. The assays were performed to determine the effect of different medial compositions, B concentrations, pH and biomass concentrations onto removal efficiency. Boron removal was investigated at 5-10 mg/L range at pH 8 in different medial compositions and maximum removal yield was found as 32.95% at 5.45 mg/L B in media with TRIA and NaHCO3. The effect of different pH values on the maximum removal yield was investigated at pH 5-9, and the optimum pH was found again 8. The interactive effect of biomass concentration and B removal yield was also investigated at 0.386-1.061 g wet weight/L biomass. The highest removal yield was found as 38.03% at the highest biomass range. This study highlights the importance of using new isolate Chlorella sp. as a new biomaterial for B removal process of waters containing B. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To resolve some economic problems and join a spirit of environmental protection, the industry of the packaging tends to replace non renewable fossil resources by renewable and biodegradable raw materials. The chitosan and the alginate, used individually, are among polysaccharides the most used in the coating of foodstuffs. These polysaccharides are linear, available, little expensive and non toxic polymers. The strategic approach targeted by this project consists in creating and developing new materials of eco-responsible packaging. The mixture chitosan-alginate would give rise to a complex, bio-composite, more stable matrix and with improved properties. In the current study, we worked on the various renewable sea raw materials to obtain a composite bio-film with chitosan-alginate. We elaborated and produced several types of films with different concentrations and ratios of chitosan and alginate. The impact of the presence or absence of a plasticizing as glycerol was studied. The chemical structure and morphology of these bio-composite films were characterized. Afterward, the antimicrobial agents, such as nisin and lysozyme, were incorporated within these bio-films and their antimicrobial efficiency against some bacterial strains and particularly the pathogenic as Bacillus subtilis, Staphyloccocus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes was demonstrated. The role of the glycerol as plasticizing and its implication not only on the quality of the produced bio-composite films but also in the incorporation of the antibacterial agent and its liberation were demonstrated. This study showed that enhanced antimicrobial activity of chitosan-alginate composite films can be achieved by incorporating nisin, thus broadening their applications by coating some food products and ensuring food quality and safety.

AB Liposome is widely used in biomedical field owing to its remarkable ability of delivery drugs. Thus, the introduction of liposomal drug delivery systems into tissue engineering scaffolds may result in good effect on tissue regeneration. In this study, we successfully fabricated a novel liposome-loaded SF nanofiber based on the eco-friendly method. The electrospun SF fibers were ribbon-shaped and the liposome-loaded SF nanofibers showed no obvious change compared with the pure silk fibroin nanofibers as showed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). While the Fourier Transform Infrares (FTIR) spectra showed some difference between pure SF nanofibers and Liposome loaded SF nanofibers. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that liposome distributed on the liposome-loaded SF nanofibers. This novel liposome loaded SF nanofiber mats can be a promising biomaterial in tissue engineering and universally used in medical field.

TI Silk nanofibre arranging improves its fibre mat transparency
SO BIOINSPIRED BIOMIMETIC AND NANOBIOMATERIALS
AB Silk fibroin, produced by the silkworm Bombyx mori, has been receiving full recognition as a biomaterial. Since nanofibres are generally in similar dimensions to biological fibres in extracellular matrices, characteristic interaction of nanofibres with cells is widely known, which is different from the conventional materials in micron scale. In the current study, nanofibre mats were produced from silk fibroins. Although silk fibroin does not absorb any visible light, silk fibroin nanofibre mats were opaque and lost transparency to visible light. This is a disadvantage to scaffolds used in cornea tissue engineering although silk nanofibres are still attractive as biomaterial. We tried to improve the transparency of silk fibroin nanofibre mats to visible light, mimicking the mechanism adopted in biological cornea tissues. The objective of this study is to increase the transmittance of silk fibroin nanofibre mats to visible light by modifying the nanofibre orientation in the mats. We showed that by increasing the orientation of nanofibres, there was an increased transmittance to the long wavelength range of the visible light. However, the transmittance to short wavelength range did not increase. One way to improve transparency would be to orient the nanofibres in its non- woven mats.

TI Influence of sterilisations on silk protein-based materials
SO BIOINSPIRED BIOMIMETIC AND NANOBIOMATERIALS
AB The authors investigated the influence of sterilisations on silk protein- based materials using the sericin gel films (SS-GFs) made from the Sericin Hope cocoons and the hornet silk cast films ( HS-CFs) made from hornet cocoons. These two kinds of silk films seem to have a great potential as biomaterials for cornea engineering because they are transparent, have mechanical properties withstanding a surgical handling and have flexibility. These silk films inspired the authors to develop a novel artificial cornea, utilising the advantageous properties. An autoclave, an ethyleneoxide gas, an autoclave followed by an ethylene oxide gas, an ethanol solution and dry heat treatments were performed on the silk films . These sterilisation methods have different influences on cell adhesion in both of the SS-GFs and HS-CFs. The authors must consider the influence of denaturation while applying silk materials in biological evaluation or clinical use as a biomaterial. Although cell compatibility of SS-GFs and HS-CFs was affected by sterilisation processes, the sterilised films managed to retain transparency after any sterilisation process. In view of these points, SS- GFs and HS-CFs have a potential as a substitute for the corneal stroma.

AB In this work, the authors propose to explore the binding potential of nonostructured multilayers produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly based on perfusion technique, which was otherwise limited to coating only. Random spherical wax templates of same size were transformed into moldable soft three-dimensional (3D) core material with different external geometries. Placement of template spheres with different sizes by sequential stacking along multiple space axes in a single construct induced internal variations leading to different patterns. Stable porous interconnected nanostructured soft 3D macroconstructs made of natural based polyelectrolytes with a controlled external shape and different internal patterns were developed after removing wax template. Such highly porous structures with hierarchical organization could be used, for example, as scaffolds for tissue engineering applications.

AB Causes mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrochemical related to the oral environment are effects ranging from simple weathering of biomaterial to the final break, through irreversible deformation, the more invisible and insidious. Study closer to all of these requirements and how to reconcile them is the goal of our work involves the development and analysis of the cements commonly used by dentists and especially cement oxy - zinc phosphate. The powder of zinc phosphate cement is typically made of zinc oxide annealing, alone or mixed with other oxides. The choice and dosage of these oxides must reflect the requirements presented to the concrete (resistance to crushing, shear, acidity, toxicity, solubility, etc...). Thus the formulation of the composition cement needs to have an optimal mix of different components to achieve desired quality cement. Therefore, we limited the number of formulas or mixtures confined to the study of a unique blend of high purity raw materials which we have subjected three regimes of firing at a fixed temperature of 1350 degrees C. The test results show that the cement produced is of very good quality and meets the required standards. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The mechanically adaptable connective tissue of echinoderms (Mutable Collagenous Tissue-MCT), which can undergo drastic nervously-mediated changes in mechanical properties, represents a promising model for biomaterial design and biomedical applications. MCT could be a source of, or an inspiration for, new composite materials whose molecular interactions and structural conformation can be changed in response to external stimuli. MCT is composed mostly of collagen fibrils, comparable to those of mammals, plus a variety of other components, including other fibrillar structures, proteo-glycans and glycoproteins. This contribution presents the preliminary results of a detailed analysis of MCT components in the sea-urchin Paracentrotus lividus, focusing on biochemical characterization of the fibrils and biomolecular analysis of the presumptive glycoproteins involved. The final aims will be to confirm the presence and the role of these glycoproteins in echinoids and to manipulate simpler components in order to produce a composite with mutable mechanical properties.

AB Medpor (R) is an alloplastic material largely employed hi craniofacial reconstruction due to its characteristics of biological compatibility, easy morphological adaptability and mantaining it's initial volume after beeing positioned. To better understand how Medpor (R) promotes bone formation we analyzed the expression levels of bone related genes in stem cells isolated from dental pulp after 15 and 30 days of exposure to the biomaterial. To this aim we focused on the expression levels of bone related genes (RUNX2, SP7, ALPL, SPP1, COL1A1, COL3A1 and FOSL1) and mesenchymal stem cells marker (ENG). Our results suggest that Medpor (R) induces osteoblast phenotype expression in human DPSCs as demonstrated by the activation of osteoblast related genes FOSL1, RUNX2 and COL3A1 and the disappearance of the mesenchymal stem cells marker, ENG.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFLAMMATION
AB Osteoplant (R) (Bioteck SRL, Vicenza, Italy) is an equine cortical and spongy bone tissue, used to fill bone defects in orthopedic, maxillofacial and dental surgery. To study the mechanism by which Osteoplant (R) induces the reabsorption and the substitution of the graft with new bone, the expression of genes related to the osteoblast differentiation were analyzed using cultures of stem cells derived from dental pulp stem cells (ADSCs) treated with this biomaterial. The up-regulation of bone related genes like SP1, FOSL1, RUNX2 and SPP1 and the disappearance of the mesenchymal stem cell marker ENG demonstrated that this biomaterial is conducive in osteoblast and osteoclast. In particular the up-regulation of SPP1 demonstrated that this bone substitute material was actively resorbed by human osteoclasts. Our results confirmed that Osteoplant (R) has high potential for use as bone tissue scaffold in bone tissue engineering.

TI P15 (R) INDUCES RUNX2 IN BONE MARROW DERIVED STEM CELLS
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFLAMMATION
AB Peptide-15 (P-15) is. P-15 an analog of the cell binding domain of collagen, has been shown to facilitate physiological process in a way similar to collagen, to serve as anchorage for cells, and to promote the binding, migration and differentiation of cells. However, how P-15 alters osteoblast activity to promote bone formation is poorly understood. In this study we investigated the osteo-inductives properties of P15 on stem cells derived from bone marrow. In Real Time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (real time RT-PCR) we quantified the mRNA expression of specific genes, like transcriptional factors (RUNX2 and SP7), bone related genes (SPP1, COL1A1, COL3A1, ALPL, and FOSL1) and mesenchymal stem cells marker (ENG). Gene expression in BMSC was then compared with the gene expression in Human Osteoblasts (HOb) treated with P15, to evaluate the potential effect of this biomaterial in osteoblasts differentiation.

TI Functional enhancement of chitosan and nanoparticles in cell culture,
   tissue engineering, and pharmaceutical applications
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB As a biomaterial, chitosan has been widely used in tissue engineering, wound healing, drug delivery, and other biomedical applications. It can be formulated in a variety of forms, such as powder, film, sphere, gel, and fiber. These features make chitosan an almost ideal biomaterial in cell culture applications, and cell cultures arguably constitute the most practical way to evaluate biocompatibility and biotoxicity. The advantages of cell cultures are that they can be performed under totally controlled environments, allow high throughput functional screening, and are less costly, as compared to other assessment methods. Chitosan can also be modified into multilayer composite by combining with other polymers and moieties to alter the properties of chitosan for particular biomedical applications. This review briefly depicts and discusses applications of chitosan and nanoparticles in cell culture, in particular, the effects of chitosan and nanoparticles on cell adhesion, cell survival, and the underlying molecular mechanisms: both stimulatory and inhibitory influences are discussed. Our aim is to update the current status of how nanoparticles can be utilized to modify the properties of chitosan to advance the art of tissue engineering by using cell cultures

TI Improvement of Thermoplastic Polyurethane Nonwoven Hydrophilicity by
   Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Treatment with He and N-2 Mixed Gases
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nonwoven has good mechanical properties for use in biomaterial. However, its inherent hydrophobic nature restricts its application. In this study, atmospheric pressure plasma treatment with He and N-2 gases was employed to TPU nonwoven material to improve the surface hydrophilicity while retaining the hydrophobicility on the back side of the material. The surface wettability was measured by water contact angle analysis, and the surface chemical composition was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The surface morphology was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The experimental results reveal that oxygen-containing groups such as C-O and O-C=O are generated on the plasma-treated TPU surface, leading to improved wettablility of the material.

TI The role of surface chemistry-induced cell characteristics on nonviral
   gene delivery to mouse fibroblasts
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Background: Gene delivery approaches serve as a platform to modify gene expression of a cell population with applications including functional genomics, tissue engineering, and gene therapy. The delivery of exogenous genetic material via nonviral vectors has proven to be less toxic and to cause less of an immune response in comparison to viral vectors, but with decreased efficiency of gene transfer. Attempts have been made to improve nonviral gene transfer efficiency by modifying physicochemical properties of gene delivery vectors as well as developing new delivery techniques. In order to further improve and understand nonviral gene delivery, our approach focuses on the cell-material interface, since materials are known to modulate cell behavior, potentially rendering cells more responsive to nonviral gene transfer. In this study, self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiols on gold were employed as model biomaterial interfaces with varying surface chemistries. NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts were seeded on the modified surfaces and transfected using either lipid-or polymer-based complexing agents.
   Results: Transfection was increased in cells on charged hydrophilic surfaces presenting carboxylic acid terminal functional groups, while cells on uncharged hydrophobic surfaces presenting methyl terminations demonstrated reduced transfection for both complexing agents. Surface-induced cellular characteristics that were hypothesized to affect nonviral gene transfer were subsequently investigated. Cells on charged hydrophilic surfaces presented higher cell densities, more cell spreading, more cells with ellipsoid morphologies, and increased quantities of focal adhesions and cytoskeleton features within cells, in contrast to cell on uncharged hydrophobic surfaces, and these cell behaviors were subsequently correlated to transfection characteristics.
   Conclusions: Extracellular influences on nonviral gene delivery were investigated by evaluating the upregulation and downregulation of transgene expression as a function of the cell behaviors induced by changes in the cells' microenvronments. This study demonstrates that simple surface modifications can lead to changes in the efficiency of nonviral gene delivery. In addition, statistically significant differences in various surface-induced cell characteristics were statistically correlated to transfection trends in fibroblasts using both lipid and polymer mediated DNA delivery approaches. The correlations between the evaluated complexing agents and cell behaviors (cell density, spreading, shape, cytoskeleton, focal adhesions, and viability) suggest that polymer-mediated transfection is correlated to cell morphological traits while lipid-mediated transfection correlates to proliferative characteristics.

TI Cultivation of Human Neural Progenitor Cells in a 3-dimensional
   Self-assembling Peptide Hydrogel
SO JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
AB The influence of 3-dimensional (3D) scaffolds on growth, proliferation and finally neuronal differentiation is of great interest in order to find new methods for cell-based and standardised therapies in neurological disorders or neurodegenerative diseases. 3D structures are expected to provide an environment much closer to the in vivo situation than 2D cultures. In the context of regenerative medicine, the combination of biomaterial scaffolds with neural stem and progenitor cells holds great promise as a therapeutic tool. (1-5)Culture systems emulating a three dimensional environment have been shown to influence proliferation and differentiation in different types of stem and progenitor cells. Herein, the formation and functionalisation of the 3D-microenviroment is important to determine the survival and fate of the embedded cells. (6-8)Here we used PuraMatrix(9.10) (RADA16, PM), a peptide based hydrogel scaffold, which is well described and used to study the influence of a 3D-environment on different cell types.(7,11-14) PuraMatrix can be customised easily and the synthetic fabrication of the nano-fibers provides a 3D-culture system of high reliability, which is in addition xeno-free.
   Recently we have studied the influence of the PM-concentration on the formation of the scaffold.(13) In this study the used concentrations of PM had a direct impact on the formation of the 3D-structure, which was demonstrated by atomic force microscopy. A subsequent analysis of the survival and differentiation of the hNPCs revealed an influence of the used concentrations of PM on the fate of the embedded cells. However, the analysis of survival or neuronal differentiation by means of immunofluorescence techniques posses some hurdles. To gain reliable data, one has to determine the total number of cells within a matrix to obtain the relative number of e.g. neuronal cells marked by beta III-tubulin. This prerequisites a technique to analyse the scaffolds in all 3-dimensions by a confocal microscope or a comparable technique like fluorescence microscopes able to take z-stacks of the specimen. Furthermore this kind of analysis is extremely time consuming.
   Here we demonstrate a method to release cells from the 3D-scaffolds for the later analysis e.g. by flow cytometry. In this protocol human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) of the ReNcell VM cell line (Millipore USA) were cultured and differentiated in 3D-scaffolds consisting of PuraMatrix (PM) or PuraMatrix supplemented with laminin (PML). In our hands a PM-concentration of 0.25% was optimal for the cultivation of the cells(13), however the concentration might be adapted to other cell types.(12) The released cells can be used for e.g. immunocytochemical studies and subsequently analysed by flow cytometry. This speeds up the analysis and more over, the obtained data rest upon a wider base, improving the reliability of the data.

AB Background Poly (propylene carbonate) (PPC) synthesized from carbon dioxide and propylene oxide has attracted considerable research attention recently. To explore the potential application of these new polymers for bone repair, it is necessary to use other biodegradable polymers to enhance the properties of PPC. Poly (3-hydroxybutyrate) was used in this study to modify the mechanical properties and biocompatibility of PPC. Methods Poly (propylene carbonate) (PPC) was melt-mixed with 30% poly (3-hydroxybutyrate) to enhance its physical properties, while maintaining the inherently high structural integrity and ductility. The mechanical strength, porosity, morphologies and biocompatibility of porous modified-PPC (PM-PPC) were fully investigated using tensile tester, hammering method, scanning electron microscopy, cytotoxicity test for its biocompatibility. Results The PM-PPC was measured by mechanical tests for its compressive strength, elongation module and tensile strength, with the results being 43 Mpa, 725 Mpa and 32 Mpa respectively. The data showed that the mechanical properties of PM-PPC were significantly improved compared with PPC. The mean porosity of PM-PPC was 15%, as determined by hammering method. The biocompatibility test of PM-PPC showed that it has excellent potential for use as a biomedical material. Conclusions In conclusion, the PM-PPC showed improved mechanical properties, and an acceptable biocompatibility supporting its potential for use in patients. Thus, PM-PPC is a promising candidate for use as a novel medical material.

AB Applications of ultrasound were starting from 1912 with the primary objective the detection of icebergs on prevention of maritime accidents. Algae, fish deaths and destruction were observed in the vicinity of sonar that equipped ships and submarines during the First World War.
   The evolutions of research and studies with ultrasound have big advances following the discovery of piezoelectric transducers in science and technology. As an example we can mention its application in microsurgery, fatigue detection in aerospace mechanics, catalysis sonochemical, biotechnology and others.
   The work presented here aims to demonstrate the application of ultrasonic in pulsed mode beams in biotechnology with the aim of improving the fermentation of a culture broth containing biological agents. In these experiments we used as ultrasound equipment and oscilator Sonics VCX-600 (20KHz), probe type wave guide. The experiments were conducted in a glass reactor of 200 mL of biomaterial containing cane juice and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in suspension. The parameters analyzed were related to the content Alcohlic (FID gas chromatography), and cell viability (Neubauer chamber), TRS (refractometry). Analysis of results showed that the total production exceeded in irradiated samples compared to normal fermentation (without ultrasound), suggesting additional advantage of ultrasound activation. Lastin Trials 1400 min, showed ethanol production systems 12% more than non-enabled systems. In this context alternatives for ethanol production, bio fuel and many other byproducts of the alcohol industries and chemicals could benefit from the use of ultrasound beams in this range of frequencies.

AB Surgical sutures are one of the most frequently used medical devices and their resorption under different conditions has been studied during the last years. Degradation in vitro (in simulated biologic fluid- SBF) of polyglycolide (PGA) multifilament sutures was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), IR spectroscopy, contact angle measurements. Also, mechanical properties as tensile strength and elongation at brake, were determined. It was found that the biodegradation process includes a steady state and accelerated stages. It was also established the important role of intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the suture stability.
   The biostability of the suture depends on polymer morphology and changes widely with the suture draw ratio. The modification in the polymer chain results in the increase of suture usefulness without significant changes of complete polymer degradation time.

AB Metal foam is energy-saving and environment-friendly materials for their relatively new class of structural characteristics. The open-cell Mg-Al alloy foam has a complex microstructure consisting of an interconnected network. The different pore size and relative density determine the complex microstructure and the mechanical properties. The Mg-Al alloy foam has not only characteristics of metal, but also a new class of properties of novel physical, mechanical, thermal, electrical, and acoustic[1]. Open-cell foam is also valuable to be a body-bone as a degradable biomaterial. It usually is used as heat exchangers, because they have a high coefficient of thenual conductivity, increased surface area. The process weak is that Mg is easy to burn. In this paper, open-cell foam was fabricated by investment casting method with the mixing gas of SF6 and CO2. These gases well solve the problem that magnesium is easy to burn. In order to apply metal foams in various fields and use them effectively, the Structure and Mechanical Properties of material must be investigated.

Furthermore, uniformity of the dose is difficult to achieve. Modern ink-jet printing technology has been successfully applied to polymer electronics and biomaterial applications. It has many advantages that could be utilized in drug manufacturing process, such as faster production cycle with fewer processing steps, precise dosing, on-demand individualized dosing and possibility for on-line quality control. This study examines how well current printer technologies function in printing different types of drug solutions on paper-like substrate. Preliminary tests were carried out with paracetamol and riboflavin-water solutions. The study denoted that printing medicines and biopolymer coating was possible, the accuracy of dose was very satisfying and personalized dosing was easy to achieve. Further studies with specially manufactured printers are still needed to determine the suitability of the ink-jet printing process in commercial drug manufacturing.

AB Separating patient identification data from clinical data and/or information about biomaterial samples is an effective data protection measure, especially in clinical research employing "on-line", i.e., web-based, data capture. In this paper, we show that this specialised technique can be generalised into a network architecture of interconnected on-line databases potentially serving a variety of purposes. The basic idea of this approach consists of maintaining logical links, i.e., common record keys, between corresponding data structures in pairs of databases while keeping the actual key values hidden from clients. For client systems, simultaneous access to corresponding records is mediated by temporary access tokens. At the relational level, these links are represented by arbitrary unique record keys common to both databases. This architecture allows for integration of related data in different databases without replicating or permanently sharing this data in one place. Each participating on-line database can determine the degree of integration by specifying linkage keys only for those data structures that may be logically connected to other data. Logical links can de designed for specific use cases. In addition, each database controls user access by enforcing its own authorisation scheme. Another advantage is that individual database owners retain considerable leeway in adapting to changing local requirements without compromising the integration into the network. Beyond protecting individual subject identification data, this architecture permits splitting a cooperatively used data pool to achieve many kinds of objectives. Application examples could be clinical registries needing subject contact information for follow-up, biomaterial banks with or without genetic information, and automatic or assisted integration of data from electronic medical records into research data.

SO SKELETAL MUSCLE
AB Background: Cell-transplantation therapies have attracted attention as treatments for skeletal-muscle disorders; however, such research has been severely limited by poor cell survival. Tissue engineering offers a potential solution to this problem by providing biomaterial adjuvants that improve survival and engraftment of donor cells.
   Methods: In this study, we investigated the use of intra-muscular transplantation of mesoangioblasts (vessel-associated progenitor cells), delivered with an injectable hydrogel biomaterial directly into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of acutely injured or dystrophic mice. The hydrogel cell carrier, made from a polyethylene glycol-fibrinogen (PF) matrix, is polymerized in situ together with mesoangioblasts to form a resorbable cellularized implant.
   Results: Mice treated with PF and mesoangioblasts showed enhanced cell engraftment as a result of increased survival and differentiation compared with the same cell population injected in aqueous saline solution.
   Conclusion: Both PF and mesoangioblasts are currently undergoing separate clinical trials: their combined use may increase chances of efficacy for localized disorders of skeletal muscle.

AB Currently, titanium and its alloys (Ti-6A1-4V or Ti-13Nb-13Zr) are one of the basic metallic materials, which are used as biomaterials in orthopedics. Research under their best corrosion and wear resistance, biocompatibility and bioactivity are still being conducted. Orthopedic implants continue to pose a big problem because of their mechanical properties are too high in relation to the properties of human bones, for example Young's modulus. Young's modulus of bone is between 10-30 GPa and the solid metals is placed between 110 GPa for Ti and 230 GPa for Co-Cr alloys. Nowadays, many researches is focused on the design, manufacturing and characterisation of the porous materials based on e.g. Ti-6Al-4V or Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloys, which would be applied for implants. Currently, there are several known methods of producing porous materials. The most common methods include: the powder metallurgy, conventional or with an use of space holders (removed by temperature or chemical treatment),plasma spraying, laser remelting, rapid prototyping, metal foam manufacturing or heat and chemical treatments. The aim of this work was to conduct the powder preparation, pressing and sintering by conventional or with space holders processes in order to obtain the porous structure material made of the Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloy. In this paper, the size and shape of the Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloy powders obtained by machining and plasma atomization processes are presented. The pressing parameters, type of space holders, in that mainly unit pressure as well as temperature and time of the sintering processes are described. The investigation results of the microstructure morphology, pore size and porosity, in dependence of the selected type space holders, pressing and sintering parameters are shown and discussed. It is expected, that the porous material with defined porosity made of the Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloy and its applications for orthopedic applications allows obtaining their high biocompatibility and bioactivity as well as cause an increase wear and corrosion resistance in contact with human body.

AB An amorphous/nanocrystalline 50Ni-50Ti powder was produced from elemental Ti and Ni powders by solid state synthesis utilizing low energy mechanical alloying with times up to 100 hr. The morphology, microstructure and phase composition of the milling products were evaluated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The results indicated that there was no chemical reaction between the elements during the milling process, which led to the direct for mation of an amorphous/nanocrystalline structure without any intermediate phase (intermetallic and/or solid solution phase) formation. It seems that the second kind of amorphization process proposed by Weeber and Bakker is governed. It was shown that the formation of amorphous phase was started after 80hr and developed during the milling for 100hr.

AB The Ti-Zr-Cu-Pd-Sn bulk metallic glasses have some advantages of high yield strength about 2000Mpa, good corrosion resistance and absence of toxic element, such as Al,Ni and Be. So the Ti-based metallic glass is regarded as a promising biomaterial and lightweight material. The homogenous deformation and superplastic forming process of Ti-Zr-Cu-Pd-Sn-Sn bulk metallic glass was investigated. The homogeneous deformation behavior is strongly dependent on the strain rate. The metallic glass exhibits Newtonian behavior at relative low strain rate and non-Newtonian behavior at relative high strain rate. The micro-gear was successfully extruded by superplastic forming process, indicating that the Ti-Zr-Cu-Pd-Sn bulk metallic glass processes good workability in supercooled liquid region. The deformed metallic glass was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), demonstrating that no detectable crystalline phase precipitated during superplastic forming.

AB Recently titanium and its alloys are finding extensive use as biomaterials due to their excellent mechanical properties, corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. Cr is a beta phase stabilizing element and Sn is also a non-toxic element. Recently, we found that cold workability of Ti-xCr-3Sn alloys was improved with Cr additions due to beta phase stabilization. In this study, mechanical properties and shape memory effect of metastable beta Ti-6Cr-3Sn alloy in solution-treated and 473K-aged conditions were. investigated. Ti-6Cr-3Sn alloy was developed by arc-melting method, homogenized at 1273K for 7. 2ks, cold rolled successfully to 96% reduction and solution-treated at 1273K for 1. 8ks followed by quenching into water. Ageing treatment was carried out at 473K for 3. 6ks followed by quenching into water. Ti-6Cr-3Sn alloy (beta phase) in solution treated conditions exhibited 585MPa UTS,41% fracture strain, HV260 hardness,305MPa yield stress and 57% shape recovery ratio. However by ageing at 473K for 3. 6ks,Ti-6Cr-35n alloy showed brittle fracture (2% fracture strain), high yield stress (440MPa), high hardness (HV329) with no shape memory effect due to omega (hexagonal) phase precipitation. In cyclic loading-unloading tensile testing with a constant strain increment, Ti-6Cr-3Sn alloy in the solution treated conditions showed pseudo elastic response. However Ti-6Cr-3Sn alloy aged at 473K for 3. 6ks did not show pseudo elastic response. It is concluded that Ti-6Cr-3Sn alloy in solution-treated conditions has potential for biomedical applications. However mechanical, shape memory and pseoudoelastic properties were drastically reduced by ageing at 473K.

AB In order to improve the fatigue strength with maintaining low Young's modulus of a biomedical beta-type titanium alloy, Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4 center dot 6Zr, a short-time aging combined with severe cold rolling was investigated. An a, phase was employed for precipitation strengthening. Because the rolling texture of beta phase is formed by the cold rolling, such the omega phase may be preferentially oriented to a direction that is effective for inhibiting the increase in Young's modulus. TNTZ aged at 573 K for 3.6 ks or 10.8 ks after cold rolling exhibits high tensile strength and acceptable elongation with relatively low Young's modulus. However, the fatigue strength of TNTZ aged at 573 K for 3.6 ks is not significantly improved. On the other hand, the fatigue strength of the TNTZ sample aged at 573 K for 10.8 ks is improved as well as its tensile strength.

AB The effect of aging temperature on microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti-25Nb-10Ta-1Zr-0.2Fe alloy was investigated. The results showed that the solution treated sample possesses good plasticity behavior. The deformation mechanism of the solution treated sample during tensile process is stress induced martensite transformation from beta phase to alpha" phase. An increase in yield strength as well as a great decrease in plasticity is observed in the alloy after aging treatments owing to the precipitates forming barriers against dislocation slip. The precipitation of omega phase in (3 phase at relatively lower aging temperature between 150-400 degrees C leads to low strength-to-modulus ratio and low elongation, whereas the precipitation of a phase at relatively higher aging temperature of 550 degrees C results in high strength, low Young's modulus and moderate elongation.

TI Active leukocyte detachment and apoptosis/necrosis on PEG hydrogels and
   the implication in the host inflammatory response
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Monocytes/Macrophages have long been recognized as key players in inflammation and wound healing and are often employed in vitro to gain an understanding of the inflammatory response to biomaterials. Previous work has demonstrated a drastic decrease in primary monocyte adherent density on biomaterial surfaces coupled with a change in monocyte behavior over time. However, the mechanism responsible for this decrease remains unclear. In this study, we explored active detachment and cellular death as possible regulating factors. Specifically, extracellular TNF-alpha and ROS production were analyzed as potential endogenous stimulators of cell death. MMPs, but not calpains, were found to play a key role in active monocyte detachment. Monocyte death was found to peak at 24 h and occur by both apoptosis and necrosis as opposed to polymorphonuclear leukocyte death which mainly occurred through apoptosis. Finally, TNF-alpha and ROS production were not found to have a causal relationship with monocyte death on TCPS or PEG surfaces. The occurrence of primary monocyte apoptosis/necrosis as well as active detachment from a material surface has implications not only in in vitro study, but also in the translation of the in vitro inflammatory response of these cells to in vivo applications.

TI Regenerative potential of silk conduits in repair of peripheral nerve
   injury in adult rats
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Various attempts have been made to develop artificial conduits for nerve repair, but with limited success. We describe here conduits made from Bombyx mori regenerated silk protein, and containing luminal fibres of Spidrex (R), a silk-based biomaterial with properties similar to those of spider silk. Assessment in vitro demonstrated that Spidrex (R) fibres support neurite outgrowth. For evaluation in vivo, silk conduits 10 mm in length and containing 0, 100, 200 or 300 luminal Spidrex (R) fibres, were implanted to bridge an 8 mm gap in the rat sciatic nerve. At 4 weeks, conduits containing 200 luminal Spidrex (R) fibres (PN200) supported 62% and 59% as much axon growth as autologous nerve graft controls at mid-conduit and distal nerve respectively. Furthermore, Spidrex (R) conduits displayed similar Schwann cell support and macrophage response to controls. At 12 weeks, animals implanted with PN200 conduits showed similar numbers of myelinated axons (81%) to controls, similar gastrocnemius muscle innervation, and similar hindpaw stance assessed by Catwalk footprint analysis. Plantar skin innervation was 73% of that of controls. PN200 Spidrex (R) conduits were also effective at bridging longer (11 and 13 mm) gaps. Our results show that Spidrex (R) conduits promote excellent axonal regeneration and function recovery, and may have potential for clinical application. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Enhancement of mesenchymal stem cell angiogenic capacity and stemness by
   a biomimetic hydrogel scaffold
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB In this study, we examined the capacity of a biomimetic pullulan collagen hydrogel to create a functional biomaterial-based stem cell niche for the delivery of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into wounds. Murine bone marrow-derived MSCs were seeded into hydrogels and compared to MSCs grown in standard culture conditions. Hydrogels induced MSC secretion of angiogenic cytokines and expression of transcription factors associated with maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4) when compared to MSCs grown in standard conditions. An excisonal wound healing model was used to compare the ability of MSC-hydrogel constructs versus MSC injection alone to accelerate wound healing. Injection of MSCs did not significantly improve time to wound closure. In contrast, wounds treated with MSC-seeded hydrogels showed significantly accelerated healing and a return of skin appendages. Bioluminescence imaging and FACS analysis of luciferase+/GFP+ MSCs indicated that stem cells delivered within the hydrogel remained viable longer and demonstrated enhanced engraftment efficiency than those delivered via injection. Engrafted MSCs were found to differentiate into fibroblasts, pericytes and endothelial cells but did not contribute to the epidermis. Wounds treated with MSC-seeded hydrogels demonstrated significantly enhanced angiogenesis, which was associated with increased levels of VEGF and other angiogenic cytokines within the wounds. Our data suggest that biomimetic hydrogels provide a functional niche capable of augmenting MSC regenerative potential and enhancing wound healing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Damage associated molecular patterns within xenogeneic biologic
   scaffolds and their effects on host remodeling
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The immune response is an important determinant of the downstream remodeling of xenogeneic biologic scaffolds in vivo. Pro-inflammatory responses have been correlated with encapsulation and a foreign body reaction, while anti-inflammatory reactions are associated with constructive remodeling. However, the bioactive and bioinductive molecules within the extracellular matrix (ECM) that induce this polarization are unclear, although it is likely that cellular remnants such as damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) retained within the scaffold may play a role. The present study investigated the immunomodulatory effects of common ECM scaffolds. Results showed that tissue source, decellularization method and chemical crosslinking modifications affect the presence of the well characterized DAMP - HMGB1. In addition, these factors were correlated with differences in cell proliferation, death, secretion of the chemokines CCL2 and CCL4, and up regulation of the pro-inflammatory signaling receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Inhibition of HMGB1 with glycyrrhizin increased the pro-inflammatory response, increasing cell death and up regulating chemokine and TLR4 mRNA expression. The present study suggests the importance of HMGB1 and other DAMPS as bioinductive molecules within the ECM scaffold. Identification and evaluation of other ECM bioactive molecules will be an area of future interest for new biomaterial development. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Theranostic Gd(III)-lipid microbubbles for MRI-guided focused ultrasound
   surgery
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB We have synthesized a biomaterial consisting of Gd(III) ions chelated to lipid-coated, size-selected microbubbles for utility in both magnetic resonance and ultrasound imaging. The macrocyclic ligand DOTA-NHS was bound to PE headgroups on the lipid shell of pre-synthesized microbubbles. Gd(III) was then chelated to DOTA on the microbubble shell. The reaction temperature was optimized to increase the rate of Gd(111) chelation while maintaining microbubble stability. ICP-OES analysis of the microbubbles determined a surface density of 7.5 x 10(5) 3.0 x 10(5) Gd(III)/mu m(2) after chelation at 50 degrees C. The Gd(III)-bound microbubbles were found to be echogenic in vivo during high-frequency ultrasound imaging of the mouse kidney. The Gd(III)-bound microbubbles also were characterized by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 9.4 T by a spin-echo technique and, surprisingly, both the longitudinal and transverse proton relaxation rates were found to be roughly equal to that of no-Gd(III) control microbubbles and saline. However, the relaxation rates increased significantly, and in a dose-dependent manner, after sonication was used to fragment the Gd(III)-bound microbubbles into non-gas-containing lipid bilayer remnants. The longitudinal (r(1)) and transverse (r(2)) molar relaxivities were 4.0 +/- 0.4 and 120 +/- 18 mM(-1)s(-1), respectively, based on Gd(III) content. The Gd(III)-bound microbubbles may find application in the measurement of cavitation events during MRI-guided focused ultrasound therapy and to track the biodistribution of shell remnants.

   hybird copolymer with adjustable molecular weight
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE
AB A novel natural-synthetic hybrid block copolymer was synthesized by Aeromonas hydrophila 4AK4 in poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, M (n) = 200) modified fermentation. This hybrid biomaterial consists of the natural hydrophobic polymer poly(3-hydroxybutyrat-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) end-capped with hydrophilic PEG, which has the increased flexibility as well as the improved thermal stability. Addition of diethylene glycol (DEG) and ethylene glycol could not result in the accumulation of hybrid block copolymer. DEG and ethylene glycol, together with PEG-200, could cause a reduction of molar mass of PHBHHx, resulting in a series of low molecular weight polymer and the reduction of the polymer yield as well as the cellular productivity. In vitro degradation of PHBHHx and PHBHHx-PEG with different molecular weight showed that the decrease of molecular weight accelerated the degradation of copolymers, but PEG modification has little effect on its degradation rate. The results in this study provided a convenient and direct method to produce a series of PHBHHx and PHBHHx-PEG materials with adjustable molecular weight and broad molecular weight distribution which will be very useful for the biomedical applications.

TI A Novel Approach for the Utilization of Biocellulose Nanofibres in
   Polyurethane Nanocomposites for Potential Applications in Bone Tissue
   Implants
SO DESIGNED MONOMERS AND POLYMERS
AB With the increasing number of surgical bone grafts per year, the application of biomaterials in tissue engineering has become a popular issue. In the present work, the potential of biocellulose-nanofibre-reinforced polyurethane nanocomposites to act as bone scaffold implants is established. Investigating properties of polyurethane shows that this widely applied biomaterial group cannot fulfil all properties required for bone implants in a stand-alone fashion. Bone implants require a high Young's modulus and tensile strength but low strain which makes it difficult to find a suitable polyurethane since higher hard segment content will reduce tensile strength and lower hard segment content will reduce the Young's modulus. Other factors such as biodegradation also become important. A literature review on carbon nanotube and nanofibre composites with polyurethanes shows that nanofibrous reinforcement leads to favourable implant properties. Young's modulus and tensile strength increase dramatically. Other properties such as thermal conductivity and viscosity are also affected. These types of nanofibrous materials, however, are the subject of an ongoing debate about toxicity and their use in bone implants is questionable. Biocellulose nanofibres formed from bacteria (also called bacterial cellulose (BC)) possess favourable mechanical properties and are highly biocompatible. A survey on works done on BC nanofibres and their composites show that nanostructured biocomposites that contains the nanofibres reinforced in polymer composites result in changes that are comparable to those of carbon nanotubes in regards to bone scaffold applications. Showing improvement on biocompatibility and mechanical properties, biocellulose nanofibre reinforcement on polyurethanes possesses strong potential for bone implants and other tissue-engineering applications.

AB Biomaterial implants are a promising strategy to replace neural tissue that is lost after traumatic nerve damage. Chitosan (Ch) is a suitable material for nerve implantation when it is used at a minimum amount of 2% (w/v). The goal of this study was to determine the best mixture of 2% Ch with gelatin (G) and poly(L-lysine) (PLL) for use in neural tissue engineering. Using different physicochemical approaches we showed that all mixtures formed polyelectrolyte complexes with distinct electrostatic interactions between their compounds. This gave rise to different gel morphologies, among which Ch + G exhibited a significantly smaller pore size, unlike Ch + G + PLL. However, thermal resistance to degradation and the wettability of the Ch-based films were not affected. Additionally, these differences affected glial cells growth in long-term (14 days) cultures performed on Ch-based films. Astrocytes and olfactory ensheathing cells proliferated on G and Ch + G films which induced both flattened and spindle cell morphologies. Meanwhile, cortical and hippocampal neurons were similarly viable in all studied films and significantly lower than those observed in controls. Lastly, neurites from dorsal root ganglia extended the most on Ch + G films. These results show that a Ch + G mixture is a promising candidate for use in neural tissue engineering.

TI Surface Phosphorylation for Polyelectrolyte Complex of Chitosan and Its
   Sulfonated Derivative: Surface Analysis, Blood Compatibility and Adipose
   Derived Stem Cell Contact Properties
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB Many studies have tried to look for the application of chitosan in tissue engineering since its structure is similar to glycoaminoglycans, the main components of the extracellular matrix. Previous studies had indicated that the incorporation of sulfonic or phosphonic functionalities would be beneficial to the growth of certain cells. However, no study has explored the effect of incorporation of both above-mentioned anionic functionalities onto the chitosan structure. In this study, we have surface-phosphorylated the polyelectrolyte film formed by chitosan and water-soluble sulfonated chitosan with the aim to incorporate phosphonic and sulfonic functionalities onto the film surface. Surface analyses by ESCA and ATR-FT-IR have shown that these two functional groups have been successfully grafted onto the surface, and that the ratio of P/S was dependent upon the weight ratio of phosphorylation agents added. Blood compatibility evaluation indicated that phosphorylated polyelectrolyte complexes extended the plasma recalcification time as compared to non-treated chitosan and direct-phosphorylated chitosan film. In addition, these phosphorylated polyelectrolyte complexes showed similar or slightly less platelet reactivity than the non-phosphorylated counterpart. In contrast, significant platelet activation and adhesion were noted on the direct-phosphorylated chitosan. This implicated the incorporation of sulfonic acid onto the phosphorylated surface can increase the platelet compatibility. An adipose-derived stem cell incubation study has demonstrated that the incorporation of both phosphonic and sulfonic acid functionalities onto the chitosan surface can enhance the stem cell growth. Therefore, the phosphorylated polyelectrolyte complexes were not only blood compatible but also stem cell compatible, and could be a novel biomaterial in tissue-engineering applications.

TI Caprine (Goat) Collagen: A Potential Biomaterial for Skin Tissue
   Engineering
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB Collagens presently used in tissue engineering are primarily of bovine or porcine origin. However, a risk of a spongiform encephalopathy epidemic has limited the use of collagen from these sources. Keeping the aforementioned perspective in mind, we explored the possibility of using domestic goat available in the subcontinent as a potential source of collagen for tissue-engineering application. This article delineates the isolation, physico-chemical characterization, biocompatibility study and wound healing application of acid soluble caprine (goat) tendon collagen (GTC). Physico-chemical characterization of 1% acetic acid extracted GTC was done by SDS-PAGE, amino-acid composition analysis, FT-IR and CD spectroscopy. Results revealed that GTC was comprised of type-I collagen. Biocompatibility study showed that GTC augmented cell adhesion, cell cycle progression and proliferation. Immuno-cytochemical analysis in conjugation with traction force microscopy further confirmed a superior focal adhesion complex mediated cell-substrate interaction in GTC. Finally, in vivo study in mice model revealed that GTC has low immunogenicity and it augments healing process significantly. Throughout the study, calf skin collagen (CSC) was used as standard for comparative evaluation. In conclusion, it can be said that GTC may find its application as biomaterial in skin tissue engineering. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2012

TI Controlled Drug Release through a Plasma Polymerized
   Tetramethylcyclo-tetrasiloxane Coating Barrier
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB A plasma polymerized tetramethylcyclo-tetrasiloxane (TMCTS) coating was deposited onto a metallic biomaterial, 316 stainless steel, to control the release rate of drugs, including daunomycin, rapamycin and NPC-15199 (N-(9-fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl)-leucine), from the substrate surface. The plasma-state polymerized TMCTS thin film was deposited in a vacuum plasma reactor operated at a radio-frequency of 13.56 MHz, and was highly adhesive to the stainless steel, providing a smooth and hard coating layer for drugs coated on the substrate. To investigate the influence of plasma coating thickness on the drug diffusion profile, coatings were deposited at various time lengths from 20 s to 6 min, depending on the type of drug. Atomic force spectroscopy (AFM) was utilized to characterize coating thickness. Drug elution was measured using a spectrophotometer or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. The experimental results indicate that plasma polymerized TMCTS can be used as an over-coating to control drug elution at the desired release rate. The drug-release rate was also found to be dependent on the molecular weight of the drug with plasma coating barrier on top of it. The in vitro cytotoxicity test result suggested that the TMCTS plasma coatings did not produce a cytotoxic response to mammalian cells. The non-cytotoxicity of TMCTS coating plus its high thrombo-resistance and biocompatibility are very beneficial to drug-eluting devices that contact blood. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2012

TI Regenerated Silk Fibroin Nanofibrous Matrices Treated with 75% Ethanol
   Vapor for Tissue-Engineering Applications
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB As an excellent biocompatible and biodegradable protein polymer, silk fibroin (SF) has found wide applications, particularly serving as therapeutic agent for tissue-engineering applications, on which both post-spin treatment and sterilization processing are crucial to drug-loaded matrices. To find a safe, effective and appropriate post-spin treatment and sterilization approach for drug-loaded biomaterial matrices is one of the major problems in the field of tissue engineering at present. In this work, a simple, safe and effective approach skillfully integrating post-spin treatment with sterilization processing was developed to drug-loaded SF nanofibrous matrices. Electrospun SF nanofibrous matrices from its aqueous solution were post-treated with 75% ethanol vapor. C-13-NMR and WAXD analysis demonstrated that such post-spin treatment rendered the structure of SF nanofibrous matrices transform from the silk I form to the silk II form. Furthermore, biological assays suggested that as-treated SF nanofibrous matrices significantly promoted the development of murine connective tissue fibroblasts. Skillfully integrated with novel sterilization processing, 75% ethanol vapor treatment could be a potential approach to designing and fabricating diverse drug-loaded SF nanofibrous matrices serving as therapeutic agents for tissue-engineering applications in that it can effectively protect the drug from losing compared with traditional post-spin treatment and sterilization processing.

TI Decreased lung carcinoma cell functions on select polymer nanometer
   surface features
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Biomaterial nanotopographies have been proposed as a means to significantly influence cell functions (including osteoblasts, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, chondrocytes, immune cells, and bacteria). In this study, lung epithelial carcinoma cell functions including adhesion (up to 4 h), proliferation (up to 3 days), apoptosis (up to 5 days), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) synthesis (up to 5 days) on poly-lactic-co-glycolic (PLGA) films with various nanotopographies were systematically investigated. Importantly, this study created PLGA films with various nanotopographies (specifically, nano-smooth, 23, 300, and 400 nm hemispherical surface features) but similar surface chemistry in order to focus only on the effect of PLGA topography on cancer cell functions. Simple and effective cast-molding and solvent evaporation methods were used to accomplish this. Atomic force microscopy, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, and water contact angle measurements verified similar surface chemistry and energy but varied topographies for all of the PLGA films prepared in this study. Lung epithelial carcinoma cell adhesion, proliferation, and morphology results indicated less cell growth and spreading on nano-smooth and 400 nm surface-featured PLGA compared to any other samples. However, results also demonstrated decreased lung epithelial carcinoma cell VEGF (a key growth factor secreted for the vascularization of tumors) synthesis on the 23 nm surface-featured PLGA compared to the nano-smooth substrates for up to 5 days. In summary, these results provided the first insights into understanding the role that PLGA nanotography may play in mediating lung carcinoma cell functions for a wide range of applications in regenerative medicine.

TI Affecting osteoblastic responses with in vivo engineered potato pectin
   fragments
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Pectins, complex plant-derived polysaccharides, are novel candidates for biomaterial nanocoatings. Pectic rhamnogalacturonan-I regions (RG-I) can be enzymatically treated to so-called modified hairy regions (MHR). We surveyed the growth and differentiation of murine preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells on Petri dishes coated with RG-Is from native or genetically engineered potato tubers. Uncoated tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) and aminated (AMI) dishes served as controls. MHRPTR_GAL sample was depleted of galactose (9 mol % galactose; 23 mol % arabinose) and MHRPTR_ARA of arabinose (61 mol % galactose; 6 mol % arabinose). Wild-type (modified hairy region from potato pectin (MHRP)_WT) fragment contained default amounts (58 mol % galactose; 13 mol % arabinose) of both sugars. Focal adhesions (FAs) indicating cellular attachment were quantified. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin genes indicating osteoblastic differentiation was performed along with staining the produced calcium with tetracycline as an indicator of osteoblastic differentiation. Osteoblasts proliferated on all the samples to some extent. The control surfaces performed better than any of the pectin samples, of which the MHRP_WT seemed to function best. FA length was greater on MHRPTR_GAL than on other pectin samples, otherwise the mutants did not significantly deviate. RT-PCR results indicate that differences between the samples at the gene expression level might be even subtler. However, tetracycline-stained calcium-containing mineral was detected merely only on uncoated TCPS. These results indicate the possibility to affect bone cell growth with in vivo-modified pectin fragments, consecutively providing information on the significance of certain monosaccharides on the biocompatibility of these polysaccharides.

TI In vitro differentiation and biocompatibility of mesenchymal stem cells
   on a novel platelet releasate-containing injectable composite
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Underlying changes in subchondral and cancellous bone precede joint degeneration in spinal discs, knees, hips, and other joints. We hypothesize that an early bone remodeling intervention therapy may alleviate or postpone the later manifestation of joint failure. Utilization of a novel biomaterial for injection deliverability to the underlying subchondral and cancellous bone during the onset of osseous changes, before severe cartilaginous damage, is proposed. In this preliminary study, we introduced novel platelet releasate-containing alginate/calcium phosphate composites for this intervention therapy and evaluated them in vitro through mesenchymal stem cell biocompatibility and induction of osteochondral differentiation. DNA quantification and gene expression profiles suggested mesenchymal stem cells were directed along an osteochondral differentiation pathway, more specifically, to the immature nonhypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype. These conclusions were based on reduced mitogenic activity, a rapid upregulation followed by suppression of Runx2 transcription factor mRNA, sustained upregulation of Sox9 transcription factor mRNA and the absence of late marker expressions for both mature articular chondrocytes and osteoblasts over the course of 14 days. Initial findings in regard to the use of these materials for bone remodeling were positive and support the execution of future studies evaluating the inflammatory and angiogenic aspects of the materials. In this study, we have considered one of the many aspects of the endochondral ossification process; neovascularization and resorption of bone with an irregular physiology need to be evaluated.

TI Biocompatibility and biodegradation of polycaprolactone-sebacic acid
   blended gels
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Tissue engineering aims at creating biological body parts as an alternative for transplanting tissues and organs. A current new approach for such materials consists in injectable biodegradable polymers. Their major advantages are the ability to fill-in defects, easy incorporation of therapeutic agents or cells, and the possibility of minimal invasive surgical procedures. Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a promising biodegradable and elastic biomaterial, with the drawback of low-degradation kinetics in vivo. In this work a biodegradable injectable gel of PCL blended with sebacic acid (SA) was prepared, to improve the degradation rate of the biomaterial. SA is known for its high degradation rate, although in high concentrations it could originate a pH decrease and thus disturb the biocompatibility of PCL. Degradation tests on phosphate buffered saline were carried out using 5% of SA on the blend and the biomaterial stability was evaluated after degradation using differential scanning calorimetry, dynamical mechanical analysis, and scanning electronic microscopy. After degradation the elastic properties of the blend decreased and the material became more crystalline and stiffer, although at a lower extent when compared with pure PCL. The blend also degraded faster with a loss of the crystalline phase on the beginning (30 days), although its thermal and mechanical properties remained comparable with those of the pure material, thus showing that it achieved the intended objectives. After cell assays the PCL-SA gel was shown to be cytocompatible and capable of maintaining high cell viability (over 90%). (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Polyvinylidene fluoride for proliferation and preservation of bovine
   corneal endothelial cells by enhancing type IV collagen production and
   deposition
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB In this study, biomaterials with different hydrophobic properties including polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) (EVAL), tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were examined in the bovine corneal endothelial cells (BCECs) culture system to elucidate their possible impact on clinical demand and scientific interest. It was found that BCECs were inhibited to attach onto the PVA surface. Conversely, relatively more hydrophobic biomaterials EVAL, TCPS, and PVDF successfully initiate BCEC adhesion. Compared to EVAL, cultured BCECs on TCPS and PVDF exhibited higher viability. Furthermore, fibroblastic transformation on EVAL and TCPS was observed at day 17, but BCECs maintained typical hexagonal shape on the PVDF surface at day 21. This phenomenon can be rescued by previously coating type IV collagen on TCPS but not on EVAL. In addition, when BCECs were cultured on PVDF, the expressions of gap junction connexin-43, differentiation marker N-cadherin, and tight junction ZO-1 were well-developed, resembling the physiological phenotypes. After examining the type IV collagen expression by Western blot analysis and protein absorption test, a possible explanation for the better proliferation and preservation of BCECs on the PVDF substrate is that PVDF is a bioactive substratum which enables BCECs to synthesize and reserve more extracellular matrix type IV collagen, paving an important way to provide a more preferential environment for BCEC cultures. Accordingly, promoting CEC growth effects after cell-biomaterial association may be applied to the tissue engineering of corneal endothelium. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Formation and Photocatalytic Decomposition of a Pellicle on Anatase
   Surfaces
SO JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH
AB The acquired dental pellicle plays a critical role in the adhesion and detachment of dental plaque bacteria. It has been reported that titanium dioxide biomaterials decompose single-protein films by photocatalysis. However, it is not known whether this can also be achieved with complex structured pellicle films. This in vitro study investigated in real-time the formation and photocatalytic decomposition of human pellicle at anatase-saliva interfaces. Nanostructured polycrystalline anatase layers were deposited on titanium-coated quartz crystals by magnetron-sputtering, serving as a model for titanium implant surfaces. The quartz crystals were used as acoustic sensors in a quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) system with dissipation. In situ UV irradiation of pellicle-covered anatase caused a statistically significant decrease of the adsorbed salivary mass. In contrast, photocatalytic decomposition of pellicle could not be observed on reference titanium surfaces. Wettability characterization revealed superhydrophilicity of anatase upon UV irradiation, whereas titanium was unaffected. XPS measurements provide further information concerning the decomposition of the salivary films. The results suggest that the photocatalytic activity of polycrystalline anatase-modified biomaterial surfaces is able to decompose complex structured macromolecular pellicle films. Therefore, this study opens the way to surface modifications supporting therapeutic approaches of biofilm removal.

SO CURRENT APPLIED PHYSICS
AB This system is focusing on characterization and spectroscopic studies of PVA and PVP blend and the blend filled with various mass fractions (2.5, 5 and 10%) of HAp because it has great potential for applications in the medical purposes. The films have been prepared by solution casting technique. The characteristic properties of the films were examined by FT-IR, X-ray, SEM, TGA and DSC techniques from room temperature to 500 degrees C. XRD scans reveal the semicrystalline nature of the prepared films and demonstrated that complexation between the blend and the HAp were occur. SEM and thermal studies confirmed these results. Three main weight loss regions were observed in TGA thermograms that reveal reduction in the thermal stability of the prepared samples as HAp content increases. Three main transition peaks were observed in DSC with a single T(g) which indicates a good miscibility of the films. The ratio Ca:P is 1.65:1 which confirm the formation of hydroxyapatite. So, the present work can be used in various bio-applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
AB This study focused on the preparation and characterization of magnetic targeted antibiotic microspheres (MTAMs). MTAMs were prepared by a sonochemical method in the presence of hydrophobic Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles and tetracycline. The properties of MTAMs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectrum, thermogravimetric analysis, vibration sample magnetometry, and bacteriostatic experiment. The results indicated that the superparamagnetic microspheres have ultrafine size (below 230 nm), high saturation magnetization (80.90 emu/g), high biocompatibility, biodegradability, controlled-release, and antibiotic effect. It has been proved that MTAMs can carry out the function of magnetic targeted drugs delivery system by putting together magnetic materials and antibiotics. The possible formation mechanism of MTAMs was also discussed. In summary, MTAMs had potential in medical imaging, drug targeting, and catalysis. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, their inherently poor corrosion and wear resistance have, so far, limited their application. Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) in an environmentally friendly aluminates electrolyte has been used to produce oxide coatings with thicknesses of similar to 80 mu m on an AJ62 magnesium alloy. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) in the visible and near ultraviolet (NUV) band (285 nm-800 nm) was employed to characterize the PEO plasma. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the coated materials, and potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a 3.5% NaCl solution were used to determine the corrosion behavior. It was found that the plasma discharge behavior significantly influenced the microstructure and the morphology of the oxide coatings and, hence the corrosion resistance. The corrosion resistance of the coated alloy was increased by changing the current mode from unipolar to bipolar, where the strong plasma discharges had been reduced or eliminated.

TI Interactions of Amines with Silicon Species in Undersaturated Solutions
   Leads to Dissolution and/or Precipitation of Silica
SO LANGMUIR
AB The biogeochemical silicon cycle is the focus for many researchers studying the dissolution of silicon species from quartz, amorphous, and biogenic silica. Furthermore, the precipitation of biogenic silica by diatoms, radiolarian, sponges, and plants is also a popular focus for research. The ornate silica structures created by these species has attracted interest from biomaterial scientists and biochemists who have studied mineral formation in an attempt to understand how biogenic silica is formed, often in the presence of proteins and long chain polyamines. This article is at the interface of these seemingly distinct research areas. Here we investigate the effect of a range of amines in globally undersaturated silicon environments. Results are presented on the effect of amine-containing molecules on the formation of silica from undersaturated solutions of orthosilicic acid and globally undersaturated silicon environments. We sought to address two questions: can silica be precipitated/harvested from undersaturated solutions, and can we identify the silicon species that are most active in silica formation? We demonstrate that none of the bioinspired additives investigated here (e.g., poly(allylamine hydrochloride), pentaethylenehexamine, and propylamines) have any influence on orthosilicic acid at undersaturated concentrations. However, under globally undersaturated silicon concentrations, small molecules and polymers containing amine groups were able to interact with oligomers of silicic acid to either generate aggregated materials that can be isolated from solution or increase rates of oligomer dissolution back to orthosilicic acid. Additional outcomes of this study include an extended understanding of how polyelectrolytes and small molecules can promote and/or inhibit silica dissolution and a new method to explore how (bio)organic molecules interact with a forming mineral phase.

AB In plant cell walls, stiff semicrystalline nano dimensional cellulose microfibrils are embedded in a pliable amorphous matrix where the size and shape of the cellulose fibrils are controlled by the dimensions of crystalline regions, providing them a unique structural and physical combination to be applied as load-bearing constituent in composites. The qualities such as specific orientation under magnetic field, extraction through simple process, abundantly available source from nature and desirable modifications have deliberately directed the intense research efforts in a number of disciplines ranging from commodity to higher applications, not only in the area of high performance polymer based composites but also to develop biosensors, magnetic strips and optical devices. The present work is focused on the use of cellulose nano-fillers for creating the self-healing function and their effect on material properties of resulting composites. The present work is in initial stage and reviews the use of cellulose nano-fillers for creating the self-healing function and their effect on material properties of resulting composites.

TI Nanopaper based on Ag/TiO2 nanobelts heterostructure for continuous-flow
   photocatalytic treatment of liquid and gas phase pollutants
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB The Ag/TiO2 nanobelt heterostructures were prepared by the acid-assisted hydrothermal method followed by an in situ photo-reduction process. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanobelts was evidently enhanced by the heterostructures between Ag nanoparticles and TiO2 nanobelts. The nanopapers based on Ag/Ti O-2 nanobelt heterostructures were fabricated via a modified paper-making process. A novel continuous photocatalytic reactor was designed, and MO removal rate of Ag/C-TiO2 nanopaper was achieved to 100% in 40 min for single layer and only in 6 min for three layers. The self-supported TiO2 nanopapers with porous structures also showed an excellent continuous photocatalytic performance for toluene gas under UV light irradiation, and the corresponding degradation rate was 69.5% in 184 min. Moreover, the Ag/TiO2 nanobelts nanopaper showed a good antibacterial effect. The multifunctional TiO2 nanopapers modified by the heterostuctures could have potential applications in the environmental and biomaterial fields. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Titanium-10 wt% 45S5 Bioglass nanocomposite for biomedical applications
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB In the present study, titanium-10 wt% 4555 Bioglass nanocomposite was successfully synthesized by the combination of mechanical alloying and powder metallurgy process. The structure, mechanical and corrosion properties of this material were investigated. Microhardness test showed that the obtained material exhibits Vickers' microhardness as high as 620 HV(0.2), which is two times higher than that of a conventional microcrystalline titanium (225 HV(0.2)). Additionally, titanium-10 wt% of 4555 Bioglass nanocomposites (i(c) = 1.20 x 10(-7) A cm(-2), E(c) = -0.42 V vs. SCE) were more corrosion resistant than microcrystalline titanium (i(c) = 2.27 x 10(-6) A cm(-2), E(c) = -0.36 V vs. SCE). The electrochemical treatment in phosphoric acid electrolyte results in porous surface, attractive for tissue fixing and growth. In vitro cytocompatibility of these materials was evaluated and compared with a conventional microcrystalline titanium, where normal human osteoblast (NHOst) cells from Cambrex (CC-2538) were cultured on the discs of the materials and cell growth was examined. On porous surface, the cells adhered with their whole surface to the insert penetrating the porous structure, while on the polished surface, more spherical cells were observed with a smaller surface of adhesion. On the other hand, the morphology of the cell cultures obtained on Ti-10 wt% 45S5 Bioglass nanocomposite was similar to those obtained on the microcrystalline titanium. The present study has demonstrated that porous titanium-10 wt% 4555 Bioglass nanocomposite is a promising biomaterial for bone tissue engineering due to its appropriate microstructure, high hardness, low E modulus, better corrosion resistance and good cytocompatibility.

TI Effect of electrodeposition current density on the microstructure and
   the degradation of electroformed iron for degradable stents
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING B-ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL SOLID-STATE
   MATERIALS
AB Pure iron has become one of the most interesting candidate materials for degradable metallic stents due to its high mechanical properties and moderate degradation. In this work we studied the effect of electrodeposition current density on microstructure and degradation of pure iron films electrodeposited on Ti alloy substrate for degradable metallic stent application. Iron sheets were produced by electrodeposition using four different current densities 1, 2, 5 and 10 A dm(-2). The films were then studied by SEM (scanning electron microscope) and EBSD (electron backscatter diffraction) to observe the surface morphology, grain size and orientation. Potentiodynamic polarization and static immersion tests were used to determine the corrosion rate and to study the degradation behavior of iron films, respectively. The current density was found to significantly influence the texture, the grain size and the grain shape of the electrodeposited iron. At current densities of 1, 5 and 10 A dm(-2), weak textures corresponding to < 1 0 1 >, < 1 1 1 > and < 1 1 2 > in the normal (electrodeposition) direction were obtained, respectively. At these current densities, average grain sizes smaller than 3 mu m were also obtained. However, at 2 A dm(-2), a strong < 1 1 1 >//ND texture with density of 7.4 MUD was obtained with larger average grain size of 4.4 mu m. The microstructure of iron samples changed after annealing at 550 degrees C because of the induced recrystallization. Different corrosion rates were obtained from potentiodynamic polarization curves of iron films deposited at different current densities because of their microstructures. Fe-2 showed the lowest corrosion rate due to its larger grains size and its texture. The corrosion rates of all iron samples decreased after annealing. Static degradation showed lower corrosion rates for iron because of the formation of a degradation layer on samples surface which reduced the degradation reaction rate. The degradation morphology was uniform for Fe-2 due to its strong texture. On the other hand, microscopic pits were found for Fe-1, Fe-5 and Fe-10. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The homopolymer poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate), produced from Pseudomonas mendocina with octanoate as a carbon feed, was studied as a potential biomaterial for soft tissue engineering, that is, as a cardiac patch and as matrices for skin tissue engineering. The polymer was fabricated into neat solvent-cast films of 5 and 10 wt Microstructural studies revealed the films as having a smooth surface topography with a root mean square value of 0.238 mu m. The films also possessed moderate hydrophilicity when compared to other monomers of the polyhydroxyalkanoate family. Stress-strain curves of the films obtained was typical of that of elastomeric polymers. This elastomeric and flexible nature of the films makes them promising candidates for the proposed applications. Biocompatibility studies with the human adult low calcium temperature keratinocytes (HaCaT) keratinocyte cell line showed that the films were able to support the attachment, differentiation, and maturation of the HaCaT cells. In vitro degradation studies over a period of 4 months showed that the water absorption and weight loss increased progressively with time for the films. The films underwent hydrolytic degradation initiated on the surface and also showed an aging effect. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 122: 3606-3617, 2011

TI Intraocular Pressure Changes: An Important Determinant of the
   Biocompatibility of Intravitreous Implants
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background: In recent years, research efforts exploring the possibility of using biomaterial nanoparticles for intravitreous drug delivery has increased significantly. However, little is known about the effect of material properties on intravitreous tissue responses.
   Principal Findings: To find the answer, nanoparticles made of hyaluronic acid (HA), poly (l-lactic acid) (PLLA), polystyrene (PS), and Poly N-isopropyl acrylamide (PNIPAM) were tested using intravitreous rabbit implantation model. Shortly after implantation, we found that most of the implants accumulated in the trabecular meshwork area followed by clearance from the vitreous. Interestingly, substantial reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) was observed in eyes implanted with particles made of PS, PNIPAM and PLLA, but not HA nanoparticles and buffered salt solution control. On the other hand, based on histology, we found that the particle implantation had no influence on cornea, iris and even retina. Surprisingly, substantial CD11b+ inflammatory cells were found to accumulate in the trabecular meshwork area in some animals. In addition, there was a good relationship between recruited CD11b+ cells and IOP reduction.
   Conclusions: Overall, the results reveal the potential influence of nanoparticle material properties on IOP reduction and inflammatory responses in trabecular meshwork. Such interactions may be critical for the development of future ocular nanodevices with improved safety and perhaps efficacy.

TI Inflammasome components Asc and caspase-1 mediate biomaterial-induced
   inflammation and foreign body response
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Implantation of biomaterials and devices into soft tissues leads to the development of the foreign body response (FBR), which can interfere with implant function and eventually lead to failure. The FBR consists of overlapping acute and persistent inflammatory phases coupled with collagenous encapsulation and currently there are no therapeutic options. Initiation of the FBR involves macrophage activation, proceeding to giant cell formation, fibroblast activation, and collagen matrix deposition. Despite the recognition of this sequence of events, the molecular pathways required for the FBR have not been elucidated. We have identified that the acute inflammatory response to biomaterials requires nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing 3 (Nlrp3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (Asc), and caspase-1, as well as plasma membrane cholesterol, and Syk signaling. Full development of the FBR is dependent on Asc and caspase-1, but not Nlrp3. The common antiinflammatory drug aspirin can reduce inflammasome activation and significantly reduce the FBR. Taken together, these findings expand the role of the inflammasome from one of sensing damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to sensing all particulate matter irrespective of size. In addition, implication of the inflammasome in biomaterial recognition identifies key pathways, which can be targeted to limit the FBR.

Here the effect of processing on the bioactivation of supramolecular biomaterials using a RNase S assay is investigated. Incorporation of S-peptides into supramolecular polymers by solvent casting shows a clear organic-solvent dependency. Although a significant release of the S-peptides is observed, RNase S activity can be measured indicating successful S-peptide surface immobilization. Additionally, the effect of electrospinning on the biomaterial's bioactivity is studied, showing that the fibrous meshes developed were bioactive. The results show the importance of solvent choice, and illustrate the potency of rendering supramolecular biomaterial films and meshes bioactive via a modular approach.

The physical and optical properties of crosslinked collagen affected by UV irradiation were analyzed using electrospectral and fluorescence studies. The electronic spectral studies showed that the photoproducts formed on UV radiation decrease in the presence of iron. Circular dichroic studies revealed that the conformational changes brought about in the protein due to UV irradiation have been reduced owing to the crosslinking with iron. However, prolonged irradiation does bring about conformational changes to the protein. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Evaluation of starch based cryogels as potential biomaterials for
   controlled release of antibiotic drugs
SO BULLETIN OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB In the present study starch has been blended with poly(vinyl alcohol) to design macroporous architectures following a repeated freeze-thaw method. These macroporous cryogels were loaded with an antibiotic drug, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (Cfx), and evaluated for its in vitro delivery in a completely controlled manner thus exploring possibilities to use it as a biomaterial in burn or wound healing applications. The key advantage of the present system is that cryogels formed do not contain any chemical crosslinking agent which is often harmful to organic compounds. These Cfx loaded cryogels were characterized by infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The controlled release of Cfx drug from cryogels was investigated under varying experimental conditions such as percent loading of the antibiotic drug, chemical architecture of the cryogels and pH, temperature, and nature of the release media. The prepared cryogels show promise to provide a possible pathway for controlling delivery of antibiotic drug thus minimizing the known side effects and improving efficacy also.

TI Type I collagen extracted from rat-tail and bovine Achilles tendon for
   dental application: a comparative study
SO ASIAN BIOMEDICINE
AB Background: Collagen has attracted great interest as a biomaterial for various dental and medical uses.
   Objective: Investigate the characteristics and biocompatibility of type I collagen extracted from rat-tail tendon and bovine Achilles tendon for dental application.
   Materials and methods: Type-I collagen was extracted from rat-tail and bovine Achilles tendon using pepsin. The purity of collagen extracts was examined using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The biocompatibility with human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and human oral keratinocytes (HOKs) was examined using an MU (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) illustrations of purified collagen alone and collagen with HGFs and HOKs were presented. A three-dimensional wound-healing model of fibroblast populated collagen lattice (FPCL) was used to determine the capability of both sources of collagen to induce wound healing in vitro. Cellular collagen lattices were fabricated to examine the contraction rate of these collagens.
   Results: The average yield of collagen extracted from rat-tail and bovine Achilles tendon were 21.8 +/- 14.9% and 5.4 +/- 0.4%, respectively. The SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the extracts were composed of alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta chains with little contamination of other small proteins. The MTT assay showed good proliferation of cells cultured with each collagen extract, indicating that collagen extracts were non-toxic to the cells. SEM and the FPCL analysis showed that both types of collagen were biocompatible with both HGFs and HOKs, inducing good contraction in the in vitro model.
   Conclusion: Type-I collagen extracted from rat-tail and bovine Achilles tendon appeared to be biocompatible with HGFs and HOKs. Both biomaterials may be of use in dental practice.

TI Antimicrobial activity of the surface coatings on TiAlZr implant
   biomaterial
SO JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCE AND BIOENGINEERING
AB This study is devoted to antimicrobial activity of new surface coatings on TiAlZr. Ti alloys such as TiAlZr are used as implant biomaterials, but, despite the good behavior of such alloys in simulated conditions, bacterial infections appear after the introduction of an implant into the body. The infections are typically caused by the adherence and colonization of bacteria on the surfaces of the implants. The study presents preparation and surface morphology characterization of coatings obtained via anodizing, as well as biomimetic coatings with hydroxyapatite and silver ions with and without antibiotic. The percentage inhibition of Escherichia coli bacteria growth was evaluated for each of the studied coating, and a Trojan-horse model of silver nanoparticles (nAg) antibacterial activity at interface was proposed. Such coatings could be more important taking into account that antibacterial treatments with antibiotics are becoming less effective due to their intensive use.

TI Nanocoating of Diazoresin/Polysaccharides Multilayer Boosts
   Biocompatibility of Nitinol Biomedical Devices
SO CURRENT NANOSCIENCE
AB The surface of a biomaterial and a biological environment are key factors determining the biocompatibility of the material. Determining biocompatibility of medical implants is a critical step toward approval and clinical application. In this study, the biocompatibility of a covalently attached nanocoating of alginate(Alg)/diazoresin(DR)/heparin(Hep) multilayer has been evaluated by thrombin inactivation, protein adsorption, leukocyte adhesion, cytotoxicity in vitro and subcutaneous implantation in vivo. It was found that the outermost layer of the coating played a key role on anticoagulant activity. No significant difference was seen in albumin adsorption between uncoated and coated one. However, the fibrinogen adsorption on DR/polysaccharides coatings was lower than the uncoated Nitinol. Compared with the uncoated Nitinol surface, DR/polysaccharides multilayer coating presented a drastically reduced adhesion in vitro of polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes (PMN) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Cell biocompatibility tests indicated that the nanocoating of DR/polysaccharides multilayer did not lead to an increase in the cytotoxicity of the Nitinol and the adherent cells maintained good viability. Subcutaneous implantation in C57BL/6 mice suggested that the coated Nitinol had good tissue biocompatibility. The use of alginate interlayer for heparin immobilization instead of proteins such as albumin, collagen, and gelatin may avoid the risk of contamination with pathogenic agents. Hence, the nanocoating of covalently attached DR/polysaccharide multilayer boosts the biocompatibility of Nitinol biomedical devices.

AB Well ordered mesoporous diopside (OMD) nanobiomaterial was synthesized by a sol gel process. The in vitro bioactivity of the OMD was evaluated by investigating the apatite-forming ability in simulated body fluid (SBF), and the hemostatic activity of the OMD was determined by measuring the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) in vitro. The results suggested that the OMD exhibited excellent in vitro bioactivity, with surface apatite formation for OMD exceeding that of non-mesoporous diopside (n-MD) at 7 days. Moreover, the OMD with high surface area possessed good hemostatic property because it could absorb a large number of water from the blood. In conclusion, the prepared OMD had excellent bioactivity and hemostatic activity, which can not only be applied as bone repair biomaterial for bone regeneration, but also as hemostatic agent for surgery hemostasis.

TI Evaluating and Modeling the Mechanical Properties of the Prepared

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB In this paper, preparation of nano-biphasic calcium phosphate (nBCP), mechanical behavior and load-bearing of poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and PLGA/nBCP are presented. The nBCP with composition of 63/37 (w/w) HA/beta-TCP (hydroxyapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate) was produced by heating of bovine bone at 700 degrees C. Composite scaffolds were made by using PLGA matrix and 10-50 wt% nBCP powders as reinforcement material. All scaffolds were prepared by thermally induced solid liquid phase separation (TIPS) at -60 degrees C under 4 Pa (0.04 mbar) vacuum. The results of elastic modulus testing were adjusted with Ishai-Cohen and Narkis models for rigid polymeric matrix and compared to each other. PLGA/nBCP scaffolds with 30 wt% nBCP showed the highest value of yield strength among the scaffolds. In addition, it was found that by increasing the nBCP in scaffolds to 50 wt%, the modulus of elasticity was highly enhanced. However, the optimum value of yield strength was obtained at 30 wt% nBCP, and the agglomeration of reinforcing particles at higher percentages caused a reduction in yield strength. It is clear that the elastic modulus of matrix has the significant role in elastic modulus of scaffolds, as also the size of the filler particles in the matrix.

TI Controlled Release of Levofloxacin Sandwiched between Two Plasma
   Polymerized Layers on a Solid Carrier
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Targeted delivery and controlled local release of drugs has a number of advantages over conventional systemic drug delivery approaches. Novel platforms for local delivery from solid drug carriers are needed to satisfy the requirements of various medical applications, in particular for the incorporation and release of hydrophilic drugs from a solid carrier material. We have utilized the plasma polymerization of n-heptylamine for the generation of two thin coated layers that serve two distinct purposes. First, an n-heptylamine plasma polymer layer is applied onto the surface of the solid carrier material in order to facilitate spreading of the drug, which is applied by solvent casting; levofloxacin in ethanol was used for this study. A second n-heptylarnine plasma polymer coating then serves as a thin barrier coating to control the release. We show that the rate of release can be adjusted via the thickness of the plasma polymer overlayer. We also show that this modality of controlled release of levofloxacin completely inhibits Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization and bioffirn formation on and near the coated biomaterial surface.

TI Anisotropy and non-homogeneity of an Allomyrina Dichotoma beetle hind
   wing membrane
SO BIOINSPIRATION & BIOMIMETICS
AB Biomimetics is one of the most important paradigms as researchers seek to invent better engineering designs over human history. However, the observation of insect flight is a relatively recent work. Several researchers have tried to address the aerodynamic performance of flapping creatures and other natural properties of insects, although there are still many unsolved questions. In this study, we try to answer the questions related to the mechanical properties of a beetle's hind wing, which consists of a stiff vein structure and a flexible membrane. The membrane of a beetle's hind wing is small and flexible to the point that conventional methods cannot adequately quantify the material properties. The digital image correlation method, a non-contact displacement measurement method, is used along with a specially designed mini-tensile testing system. To reduce the end effects, we developed an experimental method that can deal with specimens with as high an aspect ratio as possible. Young's modulus varies over the area in the wing and ranges from 2.97 to 4.5 GPa in the chordwise direction and from 1.63 to 2.24 GPa in the spanwise direction. Furthermore, Poisson's ratio in the chordwise direction is 0.63-0.73 and approximately twice as large as that in the spanwise direction (0.33-0.39). From these results, we can conclude that the membrane of a beetle's hind wing is an anisotropic and non-homogeneous material. Our results will provide a better understanding of the flapping mechanism through the formulation of a fluid-structure interaction analysis or aero-elasticity analysis and meritorious data for biomaterial properties database as well as a creative design concept for a micro aerial flapper that mimics an insect.

TI A naturally occurring nanomaterial from the Sundew (Drosera) for tissue
   engineering
SO BIOINSPIRATION & BIOMIMETICS
AB In recent years advances have been made in the design of novel materials for tissue engineering through the use of polysaccharides. This study evaluated the ability of a naturally secreted polysaccharide adhesive from the Sundew (Drosera capensis) as a support for cell growth. The Sundew adhesive has several advantages including its high elasticity and antibiotic nature. By coating glass cover slips with the Sundew adhesive, a network of nanofibers was generated that was capable of promoting attachment and differentiation of a model neuronal cell line, PC-12. We also demonstrated the potential of this material for repairing bone and soft tissue injuries, by testing attachment of osteoblasts and endothelial cells. Finally, it was determined that the Sundew biomaterial was stable through testing by atomic force microscopy and prolonged cell growth. This work has proven the capabilities of using a nanomaterial derived from the Sundew adhesive for the purpose of tissue engineering.

TI Novel mechanically competent polysaccharide scaffolds for bone tissue
   engineering
SO BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS
AB The success of the scaffold-based bone regeneration approach critically depends on the biomaterial's mechanical and biological properties. Cellulose and its derivatives are inherently associated with exceptional strength and biocompatibility due to their beta-glycosidic linkage and extensive hydrogen bonding. This polymer class has a long medical history as a dialysis membrane, wound care system and pharmaceutical excipient. Recently cellulose-based scaffolds have been developed and evaluated for a variety of tissue engineering applications. In general porous polysaccharide scaffolds in spite of many merits lack the necessary mechanical competence needed for load-bearing applications. The present study reports the fabrication and characterization of three-dimensional (3D) porous sintered microsphere scaffolds based on cellulose derivatives using a solvent/non-solvent sintering approach for load-bearing applications. These 3D scaffolds exhibited a compressive modulus and strength in the mid-range of human trabecular bone and underwent degradation resulting in a weight loss of 10-15% after 24 weeks. A typical stress-strain curve for these scaffolds showed an initial elastic region and a less-stiff post-yield region similar to that of native bone. Human osteoblasts cultured on these scaffolds showed progressive growth with time and maintained expression of osteoblast phenotype markers. Further, the elevated expression of alkaline phosphatase and mineralization at early time points as compared to heat-sintered poly(lactic acid-glycolic acid) control scaffolds with identical pore properties affirmed the advantages of polysaccharides and their potential for scaffold-based bone regeneration.

TI Cell expansion of human articular chondrocytes on macroporous gelatine
   scaffolds-impact of microcarrier selection on cell proliferation
SO BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS
AB This study investigates human chondrocyte expansion on four macroporous gelatine microcarriers (CultiSpher) differing with respect to two manufacturing processes-the amount of emulsifier used during initial preparation and the gelatine cross-linking medium. Monolayer-expanded articular chondrocytes from three donors were seeded onto the microcarriers and cultured in spinner flask systems for a total of 15 days. Samples were extracted every other day to monitor cell viability and establish cell counts, which were analysed using analysis of variance and piecewise linear regression. Chondrocyte densities increased according to a linear pattern for all microcarriers, indicating an ongoing, though limited, cell proliferation. A strong chondrocyte donor effect was seen during the initial expansion phase. The final cell yield differed significantly between the microcarriers and our results indicate that manufacturing differences affected chondrocyte densities at this point. Remaining cells stained positive for chondrogenic markers SOX-9 and S-100 but extracellular matrix formation was modest to undetectable. In conclusion, the four gelatine microcarriers supported chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation over a two week period. The best yield was observed for microcarriers produced with low emulsifier content and cross-linked in water and acetone. These results add to the identification of optimal biomaterial parameters for specific cellular processes and populations.

AB This investigation was carried out to determine whether the adsorptive and ion-exchange properties of faujasite (FAU) could be used to delivery locally the anticancer drugs gemcitanine hydrochloride (dFdU.HCl) and oxaliplatin (DACH-Pt). A soaking procedure was used for the determination of the maximum adsorption capacity of FAU and the mechanism described here was achieved. 274 mg dFdU. HCl/g FAU were adsorbed in 16 h, while 48 h were needed for the adsorption of 79.7 mg DACH-Pt/g FAU. Drug release studies were carried out by soaking the samples of loaded FAU in simulation body fluids (SBF). After only one hour 76% of dFdU. HCl was released while the release of DACH-Pt from the FAU was more normal since 38% of DACH-Pt was released in the first 24 h.

TI Implantation of biomaterial as an efficient method to harvest

SO EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB Autologous mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplants have been used successfully to treat a number of diseases, and patients undergoing cell transplantation must have stem cells collected before transplantation. In this study, we developed a new method to harvest MSCs. Biomaterials were implanted into the spatium intermuscular of mice hind limbs, and a large number of migrating cells (MCs) were isolated from the transplanted biomaterials. The adherent cells in MCs showed the characteristics of MSCs. Further comparative study demonstrated that the characteristics of MC-MSCs were similar to that of bone marrow (BM)-MSCs, including morphology, phenotype, proliferation potential, multilineage differentiation capacity and hematopoiesis-supportive function. The colony-forming unit-fibroblast frequency of the MCs was equivalent to approximately 20-fold of that of the BM. In addition, a BM transplantation experiment demonstrated that MC-MSCs were derived from the peripheral blood. In conclusion, we successfully establish an efficient method to harvest MSCs, and together with the distinct advantages of this method, such as accessibility and possibility for autologous cell therapy, we conclude that our efficient method may be a promising alternative for clinical application.

TI Determination of Trace Silver in Polymetallic Ore Samples by Flame
   Atomic Absorption Spectrometry after Solid-Phase Extraction Using a
   Microcolumn Comprising Eggshell Membrane
SO GEOSTANDARDS AND GEOANALYTICAL RESEARCH
AB A rapid and inexpensive method was developed for the determination of trace silver in polymetallic ore samples by use of eggshell membrane (ESM), a natural biomaterial, as the solid-phase extraction (SPE) adsorbent coupled with flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The ESM was used for the separation/pre-concentration of silver, and the parameters affecting sensitivity, such as pH, sample flow rate, eluent volume and eluent flow rate, were carefully investigated. ESM was found to be an effective solid phase extractant for the adsorption of trace silver over a wide range of acidity from 0.02 to 0.50 mol l-1 HNO3. The sample solution in 0.4 mol l-1 HNO3 was pumped through an ESM microcolumn at the rate of 1.0 ml min-1. Silver was absorbed, and then eluted with a solution of 1.0% m/v thiourea0.5% v/v HCl. Under these optimal conditions, ESM exhibited a good enrichment efficiency for silver with a dynamic adsorption capacity of 1.7 mg g-1. The proposed method was applied to the FAAS determination of trace silver in polymetallic ores and geological reference materials, GSO-2, 3 and 5, and GSD-11, GSD-12, and the determined values were in good agreement with certified values.

SO IET NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY
AB The resistance of nanoporous dentin biomaterial to CO2 laser irradiation was investigated by experiment and simulation for potential tooth hypersensitivity treatment. The controlled parameters including laser power of 0.03-0.150 W, scanning speeds of 11.4-34.2 mm/s and focus/defocus modes were used for studying interaction between laser energy and dentin of human tooth. Most of the dentin specimens were etched after CO2 laser irradiation with the power larger than 0.12 W at a scanning speed of 11.4 mm/s. Compared with the simulation results of temperature distribution, the maximum temperature at laser powers from 0.12 to 0.15 W is increased from 1961 to 2245 degrees C, which exceeded the melting point (1570 degrees C) of dentin's main content hydroxyapatite (HA). Increasing scanning speed can reduce the linear density of laser output energy for just locally melting porous microstructure of dentin surface without etching. Varying focus mode can also improve the damage of nanoporous dentin microstructure. At parameters of 0.150 W power and 34.2 mm/s scanning speed under defocus operation, laser treatment was successfully performed on the nano-HA coated dentin with well-molten sealing on tubules of porous microstructure at a simulate surface temperature of about 574 degrees C, which was the potential for dentin hypersensitivity cure application.

TI A SHORT-TERM FREE-FALL LANDING ENHANCES BONE FORMATION AND BONE MATERIAL
   PROPERTIES
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB To investigate the effects of a short-term free-fall landing course on local bone metabolism and biomaterial properties, 32 female Wistar rats (7 week old) were randomly assigned to three groups: L30 (n = 11), L10 (n = 11) and CON (n = 10). Animals in the L30 and L10 groups were subjected to 30 and 10 free-fall landings per day, respectively, from a height of 40 cm for five consecutive days. Animals' ulnae were studied using methods of dynamic histomorphometry, tissue geometry, biomaterial measurements and collagen fiber orientation (CFO) analysis. In dynamic histomorphometry analysis, periosteal as well as endosteal mineral apposition rates (MAR, mu m/day) were significantly higher in L30 group than in the CON group (p < 0.05). In addition, the periosteal bone formation rate (BFR/BS, mu m(2)/mu m(3)/year) was significantly higher in the L10 and L30 groups (p < 0.05). The ulnae of the animals in the two landing groups were higher in post-yield energy without significant changes in CFO, tissue size or tissue weight measurements. In conclusion, a short-term free-fall landing training produced a slight, but significant, higher bone formation in the ulnae of young female rats. Enhanced tissue biomaterial properties did not accompany size-related changes, suggesting that bone adapting to mechanical loading begins with changes in tissue-level properties.

TI Hydroxyapatite as a Carrier for Bone Morphogenetic Protein
SO JOURNAL OF ORAL IMPLANTOLOGY
AB Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) can induce the formation of new bone in numerous orthopedic and dental applications in which loss of bone is the main issue. The combination of BMP with a biomaterial that can carry and deliver proteins has been demonstrated to maximize the therapeutic effects of BMPs. However, no ideal candidate with optimal characteristics as a carrier has emerged for clinical use of BMPs. Hydroxyapatite (HA) is a potential BMP carrier with its osteoconductive properties and desirable characteristics as a bone graft biomaterial. In this study, 3 different methods to load BMP into HA materials were characterized and compared based on the BMP uptake and release profile. BMP was loaded into HA in 3 ways: (1) incorporation of BMP during HA precipitation, (2) HA immersion in BMP solution, and (3) BMP incorporation during dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) conversion to HA. The size of HA crystals decreased when BMP was loaded during HA precipitation and HA immersion in BMP solution; however, it did not change when BMP was loaded during DCPD-to-HA conversion. The highest BMP uptake was achieved using the immersion method followed by HA precipitation, and the lowest via DCPD conversion. It is interesting to note that BMP loading during HA precipitation resulted in sustained and prolonged BMP release compared with the 2 other BMP loading methods. In conclusion, BMP incorporation during HA precipitation revealed itself to be the best loading method.

TI Prevention of Hemorrhagic Complications After Dental Extractions Into
   Open Heart Surgery Patients Under Anticoagulant Therapy: The Use of
   Leukocyte- and Platelet-Rich Fibrin
SO JOURNAL OF ORAL IMPLANTOLOGY
AB Leukocyte-and platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) is a biomaterial commonly used in periodontology and implant dentistry to improve healing and tissue regeneration, particularly as filling material in alveolar sockets to regenerate bone for optimal dental implant placement. The objective of this work was to evaluate the use of L-PRF as a safe filling and hemostatic material after dental extractions (or avulsions) for the prevention of hemorrhagic complications in heart surgery patients without modification of the anticoagulant oral therapy. Fifty heart surgery patients under oral anticoagulant therapy who needed dental extractions were selected for the study. Patients were treated with L-PRF clots placed into 168 postextraction sockets without modification of anticoagulant therapy (mean international normalized ratio = 3.16 +/- 0.39). Only 2 patients reported hemorrhagic complications (4%), all of which resolved a few hours after the surgery by compression and hemostatic topical agents. Ten patients (20%) showed mild bleeding, which spontaneously resolved or was resolved by minimal compression less than 2 hours after surgery. No case of delayed bleeding was reported. The remaining 38 patients (76%) showed an adequate hemostasis after the dental extractions. In all cases, no alveolitis or painful events were reported, soft tissue healing was quick, and wound closure was always complete at the time of suture removal one week after surgery. The proposed protocol is a reliable therapeutic option to avoid significant bleeding after dental extractions without the suspension of the continuous oral anticoagulant therapy in heart surgery patients. Other applications of the hemostatic and healing properties of L-PRF should be investigated in oral implantology.

TI TiO2 supported on rod-like mesoporous silica SBA-15: Preparation,
   characterization and photocatalytic behaviour
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN
AB TiO2 nanoparticles have been successfully incorporated in the pores of mesoporous silica SBA-15 with different morphologies by a wet impregnation method. The composites were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N-2-sorption and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) was used to study their photocatalytic property. It is indicated that the morphology of SBA-15 had a great influence on the photocatalytic activity of the composites. When TiO2/SBA-15 composite was prepared by loading TiO2 nanoparticles on uniform rod-like SBA-15 of 1 mu m length, it showed higher photocatalytic degradation rate than that on less regular but much larger SBA-15 support. This difference was rationalized in terms of the homogeneously distributed and shorter channels of rod-like SBA-15, which favored mass transport and improved the efficient utilization of the pore surface.

TI Antibody sensed protein surface conformation
SO MATERIALS TODAY
AB Upon implantation into a living host, biomaterial surfaces are rapidly coated with a dynamic protein layer. The interactions of this protein layer and cells with biomaterial surfaces are widely studied because of their implications to a wide range of applications, such as the development of new materials for cell culture, dental and surgical implants(1-5), and biosensors(6-10). The deposited protein layer helps to facilitate the adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of cells on synthetic biomaterials and is composed of many proteins, including extracellular matrix (ECM) and serum proteins such as fibronectin, laminin, and collagen. The behavior of these proteins, including their conformation, are known to be highly dependent on surface chemistry, topography, and rigidity of the substrate, and for in vitro situations, the solvent used to disperse the proteins(3,11,12). These factors influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, thus, affecting the cell behavior upon exposure to the biomaterial surface. Therefore, it is possible to control cellular adhesion and differentiation on a given polymer surface by controlling the nano-morphology, and hence, the protein conformation.

TI Femtosecond laser nanofabrication of hydrogel biomaterial
SO MRS BULLETIN
AB In recent years, biomaterial investigators have increasingly focused their research on hydrogels and their capability to be fabricated into tissue engineering scaffolds. Although several fabrication methods have been used to produce hydrogel scaffolds, those methods are unable to routinely produce three-dimensional submicron and nanoscale scaffolds with precise control of the geometry, a crucial factor necessitated by the recent developments in the field of tissue engineering. Femtosecond laser-induced two-photon polymerization is a promising technique that fulfills these requirements. In our work, we used a femtosecond laser to fabricate three-dimensional submicron-scale scaffolds with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The modulus, dimensions, and shape of the scaffold can be readily adjusted by changing both the laser parameters and the molecular weight of the PEG prepolymer. With the femtosecond laser, we also fabricated two-dimensional topographical patterns, which have important applications in basic biological research. To improve the throughput of femtosecond laser fabrication, we integrated the femtosecond direct-write process with a nano-imprint process by which the femtosecond laser is used to produce nano-patterned molds. We then carried out nanoimprinting to transfer the nanofeatures in the mold to the hydrogel in a massively parallel fashion.

TI Matrix-assisted pulsed laser methods for biofabrication
SO MRS BULLETIN
AB Controlling the spatial arrangement of biomaterials, including living cells, with high resolution (+/-5 mu m) provides the foundation for fabricating complex biologic systems for studies ranging from the fundamentals of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions to applications in tissue engineering. However, the level of spatial control required cannot be obtained through conventional cell processing techniques (e.g., pipetting of or even ink-jetting cells), as they lack the precision, reproducibility, and speed required for the rapid fabrication of idealized engineered constructs. Laser direct-write approaches (e.g., matrix-assisted pulsed-laser evaporation direct-write [MAPLE DW]), previously employed for the rapid prototyping of electronics, have shown reliable patterning of biomaterials with a spatial resolution of +/-5 mu m. Moreover, recent advances allow the rapid, precise deposition of viable mammalian cells and pluripotent stem cells on well-defined substrates, enabling the laser direct-writing platform to advance manipulation of the in vitro cellular microenvironment (e.g., the stem cell niche). Herein, we review the mechanisms and recent advances demonstrating the versatility and biofabrication potential of one particular laser-based technique, MAPLE DW.

Recent research highlights their potential as biomimetic composites and application in biosensing, lab-on-chip devices, drug delivery and tissue engineering. Here we focus on the emerging class of biomaterials that integrate polymers with nanostructured porous silicon and emphasize the design of advanced 'smart' functions. Porous silicon is an appealing biomaterial due to the ease of tuning its many attractive properties, including pore morphology, photonic properties, biocompatibility, biodegradation and surface chemistry. An overview is presented of the principle concepts of design and fabrication of porous silicon-polymer hybrids. Current achievements in biomedical applications are reviewed and future prospects and challenges for healthcare technologies are discussed.

TI Three-Dimensional Visualization of Bioactive Glass-Bone Integration in a
   Rabbit Tibia Model Using Synchrotron X-Ray Microcomputed Tomography
SO TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A
AB Synchrotron X-ray microcomputed tomography (SR microCT), with a micron resolution, was used to evaluate the osteoconduction and osteointegration by borate bioactive glass after implantation 12 weeks in a rabbit tibia model. The study focused on the biomaterial-bone interface. Results from SR microCT two-dimensional and three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions provided precise imaging of the biomaterial-bone integration and detailed microarchitecture of both the bone-like glass graft and the newly formed trabecular bone. Osteoconduction, the formation of new trabecular bone within a tibia defect, occurred only in the tibiae implanted with teicoplanin-loaded borate glass but not in those with teicoplanin-loaded CaSO(4) beads, indicating the excellent biocompatibility of the glass implants. 3D reconstruction of the tibiae also showed the infiltration of vascular tissue in both the bioactive glass graft and the new trabecular bone. This study indicates that SR microCT can serve as a valuable complementary technique for imaging bone repair when using bioactive glass implants.

TI Fibrin Encapsulation and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Delivery
   Promotes Ovarian Graft Survival in Mice
SO TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A
AB Ovarian cryopreservation before chemotherapy and autotransplantation post-treatment can restore fertility to women with premature ovarian failure. Although the majority of primordial follicles survive the cryopreservation cycle, the follicular pool is reduced after transplantation due to ischemic death. Therefore, we engineered a biomaterial-based system to promote angiogenesis in a mouse model of ovarian transplantation. To mimic the clinical situation of sterility, a bilateral ovariectomy was performed 2 weeks before transplantation, during which time serum levels of follicular stimulating hormone rose to menopausal levels. Before transplantation, vitrified/thawed ovarian tissue from 12-day-old C57Bl/6J pups was encapsulated in fibrin modified with heparin-binding peptide (HBP), heparin, and loaded with 0.5 mu g vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The group transplanted with fibrin-HBP-VEGF had twice as many surviving primordial follicles and an increased number of blood vessels relative to the no biomaterial control. Transplanted tissue was viable and supported natural conception that led to live and healthy offspring. The timeline of live births with VEGF delivery suggested that primary follicles survived transplantation, and provided the gametes for the first litter. Thus, VEGF delivery from fibrin supported integration of the transplant with the host, promoted angiogenesis, and enhanced engraftment and function of the tissue.

TI Evaluation of a Thin and Mechanically Stable Collagen Cell Carrier
SO TISSUE ENGINEERING PART C-METHODS
AB The biological function of adherent cell populations strongly depends on the physical and biochemical properties of extracellular matrix molecules. Therefore, numerous biocompatible cell carriers have been developed to specifically influence cell attachment, proliferation, cellular differentiation, and tissue formation for diverse cell culture applications and cell-based therapies. In the present study, we evaluated the mechanical and the cell biological properties of a novel, thin, and planar collagen scaffold. The cell carrier is based on fibrillar bovine collagen type I and exhibits a low material thickness coupled with a high mechanical stability as measured by tensile tests. The influence of this new biomaterial on cell viability, proliferation, and cell differentiation was analyzed using 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) proliferation assay, immunocytochemistry, water-soluble tetrazolium salt-1 assay (WST-1), live cell imaging, and electron microscopy. Cell culture experiments with the human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2, human mesenchymal stem cells, and rodent cardiomyocytes demonstrated the in vitro biocompatibility of this chemically noncrosslinked scaffold. Both the mechanical characteristics and the in vitro biocompatibility of this collagen type I carrier facilitate the engineering of thin transferable tissue constructs and offer new possibilities in the fields of cell culture techniques, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine.

TI Utilization of in vitro methods to determine the biocompatibility of
   intraocular lens materials
SO TOXICOLOGY IN VITRO
AB In vitro methods for measuring the adhesion and viability of lens epithelial cells on implant devices are needed to assess material biocompatibility. We investigated whether the use of confocal microscopy and spectrophotometric methods could determine the viability and adhesion of cells on a silicone biomaterial. Human lens epithelial cells adhered to silicone were treated with 0.01% benzalkonium chloride (cationic surfactant), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (anionic surfactant), and 10% Tween 20 (nonionic surfactant). Cell viability was then assessed using two fluorescent dyes (calcein and ethidium homodimer-1). Adhesion was determined directly by measuring the number of attached cells after surfactant treatment and by an indirect method that utilized the colorimetric agent crystal violet. The number of viable cells remaining on the biomaterial was determined both immediately after exposure and after the cells were allowed to grow for 1 day following surfactant exposure. The measurements for adhesion showed that the anionic surfactant weakened cell surface binding more than the cationic or nonionic surfactant. This study demonstrated that confocal microscopy in conjunction with crystal violet as an indirect colorimetric indicator can quantify the viability and adhesion of human lens epithelial cells attached to a material surface.

TI Stem cells of the human cornea
SO BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN
AB Introduction: Blindness affects 50 million individuals worldwide; a significant proportion of them require a cell or tissue-based repair or replacement strategy to mend their damaged or diseased cornea. This review will focus on the epithelial stem cell (ESC) population of the cornea, where they reside, how they are identified and what alternative cells can be used as functional substitutes.
   Source of data: Data for this review were collated after performing literature searches by inserting key words (cornea, limbal, stem cells (SCs), epithelium, stroma, and endothelium) into the search engine PubMed.
   Areas of agreement: The prevailing notion is that corneal ESCs reside in an exclusive niche and their activation is dictated by niche-specific signals.
   Areas of controversy: Recent studies refute this hypothesis, as the central cornea of many animal species also possesses similar proliferative and clonogenic activity. The other area of controversy is in relation to the use of autologous and/or allogeneic cell therapies which are mostly contaminated with xenogeneic factors, potentially exposing the recipient to potentially harmful foreign infection.
   Growing points: Due to the shortage of donor corneal biomaterial, alternative cellular sources are being sought, discovered and trialed.
   Areas timely for developing research: With the exception of conjunctival and oral mucosal epithelium, no other cell type has been successfully used to treat patients with severe corneal epithelial defects. Embryonic and foetal SCs may have the greatest potential of all; however there are moral, legal, religious and scientific hurdles to overcome before they become routinely used in the clinic.

SO BIOMACROMOLECULES
AB A combination of sample manipulation and rheological characterization at the microscale is used to identify the gelation of poly(ethylene glycol)-heparin hydrogels over a wide range of compositions. A microfluidic device produces 50-100 droplet samples, each with a different composition. Multiple particle tracking microrheology is used to measure the rheological state of each sample. This combination requires little material and enables efficient and rapid screening of gelation conditions. The high resolution data identifies the gelation reaction percolation boundaries and a lower limit of the total hydrogelator concentration for gelation to occur, which can be used for the subsequent engineering, testing, and processing of these materials.

TI Layer-by-Layer Self-Assembly of Chitosan and Poly(gamma-glutamic acid)
   into Polyelectrolyte Complexes
SO BIOMACROMOLECULES
AB Chitosan (Ch) is a nontoxic and biocompatible polysaccharide extensively used in biomedical applications. Ch, as a polycation, can be combined with anionic polymers by layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly, giving rise to multilayered complexed architectures. These structures can be used in tissue engineering strategies, as drug delivery systems, or artificial matrices mimicking the extracellular microenvironment. In this work, Ch was combined with poly(gamma-glutamic acid) (gamma-PGA). gamma-PGA is a polyanion, which was microbially produced, and is known for its low immunogenic reaction and low cytotoxicity. Multilayered ultrathin films were assembled by LbL, with a maximum of six layers. The interaction between both polymers was analyzed by ellipsometry, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and zeta potential measurements. Ch/gamma-PGA polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) revealed no cytotoxicity according to ISO 10993-5. Overall, this study demonstrates that Ch can interact electrostatically with gamma-PGA forming multilayered films Furthermore, this study provides a comprehensive characterization of Ch/gamma-PGA PEM structures, elucidating the contribution of each layer for the nanostructured films. These model surfaces can be useful substrates to study cell-biomaterial interactions in tissue regeneration.

TI Development of proteomic tools to study protein adsorption on a
   biomaterial, titanium grafted with poly(sodium styrene sulfonate)
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL
   AND LIFE SCIENCES
AB It is known that protein adsorption is the initial interaction between implanted biomaterials and biological environment. Generally, a complex protein layer will be formed on material surfaces within a few minutes and the composition of this layer at the interface determines the biological response to the implanted material, and therefore the long-term compatibility of the biomaterial. Despite different techniques exist to observe protein adsorption on biomaterials, none of them led to the identification of adsorbed proteins. In this paper, we report a chromatographic technique coupled to proteomics to analyse and identify proteins from complex biological samples adsorbed on biomaterial surfaces. This approach is based on (1) elaboration of the chromatographic support containing the biomaterial (2) a chromatography step involving adsorption of proteins on the biomaterial (3) the high-resolution separation of eluted proteins by 2-DE gel and (4) the identification of proteins by mass spectrometry. Experiments were performed with proteins from platelets rich plasma (PRP) adsorbed on a biomaterial which consist in titanium bioactivated with PolyNaSS. Our results show that chromatographic approach combined to 2-DE gels and mass spectrometry provides a powerful tool for the analysis and identification of proteins adsorbed on various surfaces.

TI DNA/protamine complex paste for an injectable dental material
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB A DNA/protamine complex powder was prepared by reaction between DNA and protamine sulfate solution with stirring in order to develop a new injectable biomaterials for dental therapy. The powder of DNA/protamine complex became paste by kneading the complex powder and distilled water. Complex formation was confirmed by FT-IR measurement. The complex paste had a porous structure and its viscosity was approximately 280.1 Pas. The paste could easily pass through a needle of 0.25 mm internal diameter. It seemed that DNA/protamine complex paste has suitable viscosity for clinical use as an injectable biomaterial. Although, the complex paste delayed the growth speed of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia for limited periods, it cannot kill and inhibit growing bacteria. The complex paste disk showed a mild tissue response and gradually degraded after the implantation into the soft tissue of rats. These results suggested that this DNA/protamine complex paste could be a useful material for a biodegradable biomaterial. In particular, this paste will be applicable as an injectable biomaterial using syringe for the repair of defects of living tissue, GBR treatment and/or GTR treatment in dentistry.

TI The influence of Sr and H3PO4 concentration on the hydration of SrCaHA
   bone cement
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB Sr-contained calcium hydroxyapatite (SrCaHA) cement is a potential biomaterial for in vivo bone repair and surgery fixation due to its excellent biodegradability, bioactivity, biocompatibility, easily shaping and self-hardening. We had ever reported the in vitro physiochemical properties, biocompatibility and in vivo degradability of the SrCaHA cement obtained by mixing a cement powder of Ca-4(PO4)(2)O/CaHPO4/SrHPO4 and a cement liquid of diluted H3PO4 aqueous solution. In the present study, we intensively studied the influences of both Sr content and H3PO4 concentration in diluted phosphoric acid aqueous solution on the setting time, hydration heat-liberation behaviours, and real-time microstructure and phase evolutions of the SrCaHA cement. The results show that both PO4 (3-) and H+ ions in PA solution attended the hydration reaction as reactants, and thus the increase of the PA concentration not only promoted the dissolution of Ca-4(PO4)(2)O but also pushed the hydration progress of SrCaHA bone cement. Sr content exhibits a remarkable retardation role on the apatite transformation of the SrCaHA cement pastes which probably attributed to its higher degree of supersaturation for yielding apatite crystals and lower transformation rate when exposed to the Sr2+-containing hydration system. This present results contribute to a better understanding on the hydration mechanism of the new SrCaHA cement and help to the more precisely controlling of its hydration process.

TI Photoinduced graft polymerization of 2-methacryloyloxyethyl
   phosphorylcholine on silicone hydrogels for reducing protein adsorption
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB The biomimetic synthetic methacrylate monomer containing a phosphorylcholine group, 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC), has been widely used to improve the surface property of biomaterials. In the current report, both hydrophilic and antifouling surfaces were prepared on silicone hydrogels with MPC grafted by UV-induced free radical polymerization. The MPC-grafted silicone hydrogels were characterized by graft yield and static water contact angle (SCA) measurements. According to the results, the graft yield reached a maximum at 5 min of UV exposure time and 8 wt% MPC concentration. The modified silicone hydrogels possessed hydrophilic surfaces with the lowest water contact angle of 20A(0). The oxygen permeability of the MPC-grafted silicone hydrogels was as high as the unmodified silicone hydrogel. The mechanical property of silicone hydrogels was maintained at about 95% of the tensile strength and elastic modulus after the MPC grafting. The results of the in vitro single protein adsorption on the MPC-grafted silicone hydrogels were in agreement with the SCA measurements. The smaller the water contact angle, the greater was the protein repelling ability. The MPC-grafted silicone hydrogel is expected to be a novel biomaterial which possesses excellent surface hydrophilicity, antifouling property, oxygen permeability and mechanical property.

TI Characterization of a Cartilage-Like Engineered Biomass Using a
   Self-Aggregating Suspension Culture Model: Molecular Composition Using
   FT-IRIS
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH
AB Maintenance of chondrocyte phenotype and robust expression and organization of macromolecular components with suitable cartilaginous properties is an ultimate goal in cartilage tissue engineering. We used a self-aggregating suspension culture (SASC) method to produce an engineered cartilage, "cartilage tissue analog" (CTA). With an objective of understanding the stability of phenotype of the CTA over long periods, we cultured chondrocytes up to 4 years and analyzed the matrix. Both early (eCTAs) (6 months) and aged (aCTAs) (4 years) showed type II collagen throughout with higher concentrations near the edge. Using Fourier transform-infrared imaging spectroscopy (FT-IRIS), proteoglycan/collagen ratio of eCTA was 2.8 times greater than native cartilage at 1 week, but the ratio was balanced to native level (p = 0.017) by 36 weeks. Surprisingly, aCTAs maintained the hyaline characteristics, but there was evidence of calcification within the tissue with a distinct range of intensities. Mineral/matrix ratio of those aCTA with "intensive" calcification was significantly higher (p = 0.017) than the "partial," but when compared to native bone the ratio of "intensive" aCTAs was 2.4 times lower. In this study we utilized the imaging approach of FT-IRIS and have shown that a biomaterial formed is compositionally closely related to natural cartilage for long periods in culture. We show that this culture platform can maintain a CTA for extended periods of time (4 years) and under those conditions signs of mineralization can be found. This method of cartilage tissue engineering is a promising method to generate cartilaginous biomaterial and may have potential to be utilized in both cartilage and boney repairs.

SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRAUMA
AB Intramedullary femoral nailing is the gold standard for femoral shaft fixation but only in the past 27 years. This rapid replacement of closed traction and cast techniques in North America was a controversial and contentious evolution in surgery. As we enter the fourth generation of implant design, capabilities, and surgical technique, it is important to understand the driving forces for this technology. These forces included changes in radiographic imaging capabilities, biomaterial design and computer-assisted manufacturing, and the recognition of the importance of mobilization of the trauma patient to avoid systemic complications and optimize functional recovery.

TI Novative Biomaterials Based on Chitosan and Poly(epsilon-Caprolactone):
   Elaboration of Porous Structures
SO JOURNAL OF POLYMERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB The swelling capability of chitosan was explored in order to use water both, as volatile plasticizer and as pore-forming agent. Chitosan powder was swelled in acidic aqueous solution and melt blended with poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL). After stabilization at 57% RH and 25 A degrees C, samples suffered a water mass loss of around 30 wt% without dimensions variation. Despite the low miscibility of these biopolymers, quite homogeneous dispersion of chitosan within the polyester matrix was obtained. Some interactions between both biopolymers could be observed. To obtain chitosan phase with a thermoplastic-like behaviour, the plasticization effect was also studied by the addition of 25 wt% glycerol as non volatile plasticizer. The equilibrium moisture content of samples increased with the incorporation of glycerol due to its hydrophilic nature. Morphology, thermal and mechanical properties of the blends were determined after stabilization. The preparation of rich PCL blends allowed the formation of macroporous structures since samples were not contracted after water loss and stabilization. These biomaterials with such a porous structure could be used for biomedical applications.

TI Influence of systemic administration of atelocollagen on mouse livers:
   an ideal biomaterial for systemic multidrug delivery
SO JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Atelocollagen (AC), a biomaterial with low antigenicity and high bioaffinity, has been widely used in implantable materials in clinical practice. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that AC is a potential drug carrier for local and systemic delivery of cytokines, growth factors, plasmid DNA, small interfering RNA, and microRNA. AC is also believed to have low systemic toxicity on the basis of the safety of implant usage; however, this is not enough determined. Therefore, we performed whole genome expression profiling in mouse liver after systemic administration of AC or the cationic liposome carrier DOTAP/cholesterol (LP) and compared the changes of gene expressions associated with hepatotoxicity. Microarray analysis revealed that systemic LP administration significantly increased expression of toxicity-related genes, i.e., those for lipocalin-2, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A, serum amyloid A isoforms, chemokine ligands, and granzyme B. Alternatively, AC administration did not alter the expression of any of these genes. Further gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis highlighted the characteristic annotations extracted from genes upregulated after LP administration, and most of them were related to toxicity annotations such as immune response, inflammatory response, and apoptosis induction. In contrast, GO enrichment analysis of genes induced after AC administration revealed that only three annotations, all of which were unrelated to toxicity. These findings indicate that AC is potentially far less hepatotoxic than LP after systemic administration, suggesting that AC may be an excellent biomaterial for nontoxic drug delivery system carriers.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING C-MATERIALS FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB In this paper, ternary Mg-Zn-Ca magnesium alloys were investigated as degradable biomedical material. Tensile results showed that the mechanical properties of the alloys can be modulated by controlling Zn content. With increasing Zn contents, yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and ductility of the materials are increased at first and then decreased. In-vitro corrosion tests in Hank's simulated body fluid presented that the composition and microstructure of Mg-Zn-Ca alloys strongly affected their corrosion behavior. An increasing content of Zn element can lead to a high corrosion potential and bad corrosion resistance. The cytotoxicity evaluated by neutral red kits on L-929 cells revealed that Mg-1.0 Zn-1.0Ca, Mg-2.0 Zn-1.0 Ca, and Mg-3.0 Zn-1.0 Ca alloys did not induce toxicity in cells. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING C-MATERIALS FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB This first generation investigation evaluates the in vitro tribological performance of laser-processed Ta coatings on Ti for load-bearing implant applications. Linear reciprocating wear tests in simulated body fluid showed one order of magnitude less wear rate, of the order of 10(-4) mm(3)(N.m)(-1), for Ta coatings compared to Ti. Our results demonstrate that Ta coatings can potentially minimize the early-stage bone-implant interface micro-motion induced wear debris generation due to their excellent bioactivity comparable to that of hydroxyapatite (HA), high wear resistance and toughness compared to popular HA coatings.

TI The effect of black coral extraction on acute lung inflammation induced
   by cigarette smoke in mice
SO EXPERIMENTAL LUNG RESEARCH
AB Short-term exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) introduces an abundance of free radicals into the lungs, causing oxidative stress and inflammation. CS is an important risk factor related to the pathogenesis of several pulmonary diseases, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Black coral (BC) is a marine biomaterial commonly used for cigarette holders in southeast China. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the in vivo bioactivity of BC extract (BCE). Groups of mice (male Kunming) were subjected to ultrasonic atomizing inhalation of BCE (0.3, 1.5, and 3 mg/mL) before being exposed to CS (10 cigarettes per day for 4 days). The control group and the CS group were administered normal saline rather than BCE prior to CS exposure. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels were measured in lung homogenates. Histologic and morphologic studies of the right upper lung were performed. SOD activity increased 1.32 times in the CS+BCE (3 mg/mL) group (P < .001) compared with the CS group. The MDA content increased 4% (P < .001) in the CS+BCE (3 mg/mL) group compared with the control group. MPO was reduced 40% in the CS+BCE (3 mg/mL) group compared with the CS group (P < .001). Histologic analysis revealed decreased inflammation in the BCE group compared with the CS group. These results suggest that BCE has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity in vivo. BCE may protect against lung injury in smokers.

AB The goal of nanomaterials' surface modification using a biomaterial is to preserve the materials' bulk properties while modifying only their surface to possess desired recognition and specificity. Here, we have developed a phase-assisted, modified Brust-Schiffrin methodological synthesis of metallo nanocomplexes anchored by a peptide, N,N'-(1,3-propylene)-bis-hippuricamide. The spectral, thermal and morphological characterizations assure the formation of nanocomplexes. Therapeutic behavior of all the nanocomplexes has been well sighted by evaluating their DNA unpacking skills. In addition, we demonstrate their biological inspiration by targeting few bacterial and fungal strains. The in vitro antimicrobial investigation reports that all the nanocomplexes disrupt microbial cell walls/membranes efficiently and inhibit the growth of microbes. These sorts of nanocomplexes synthesized in large quantities and at low cost, deliver versatile biomedical applications, and can be used to treat various diseases which may often cause high mortality.

AB Tissue engineering has been progressed rapidly due to availability of numerous technologies pertaining to scaffold's fabrication, cell culture techniques and improved understanding of cell-scaffold interactions, both in vitro and in vivo. Recently, biomaterials in the form of nanofibers have been introduced as tissue scaffolds after their successful fabrication by various methods such as electrospinning, self-assembly and phase separation. The scaffolds made of nanofiber biomaterials have widely used in various soft and hard tissue engineering applications. However, full replication (biomimicking) of natural extracellular matrix (ECM) in vitro is still a challengeable task to biomaterial scientists and engineers. In this paper, we summarized the various types of multi-functional biomaterials that have been used for the fabrication of nanofibrous scaffolds, their fabrication techniques, and their application in tissue engineering. On the other hand, the discovery of several types of stem cells and their response to nanofiber biomaterials further help in advancing tissue engineering research. Of particular interest, impact of stem cells behaviors such as isolation, adhesion, proliferation and differentiation onto nanofibrous scaffolds has been discussed in the context of tissue engineering and regeneration. Future prospects of nanofiber biomaterials in tissue engineering are also discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS AND TISSUE ENGINEERING
AB Developments during the past decade in gradient biomaterials have resulted in a tremendous upsurge of interest in generating spatially and temporally complex cell microenvironmental features at different length scales. Micro- and nanotechnological innovations have enabled the manipulation of such gradient biomaterials suitable for numerous biomaterial applications including basic cell studies, drug screening, and tissue engineering. Gradient biomaterials have recently been used to repair or regenerate complex tissues such as soft to hard interface tissues, which fail to recover their function through conventional tissue engineering approaches used for homogenous tissues. In this regard, there is a great need for the development of improved biomaterial systems with gradient in material composition and properties that encourage the differentiation of multiple cell phenotypes and tissue development, which can help engineering more complex tissues. The purpose of this review is to describe various gradient biomaterials employed in tissue engineering, their methods of fabrication, and challenges that must be met in order for them to reach their full potential. This review is expected to be useful for readers to gain knowledge on the state-of-the-art of tissue engineering using gradient biomaterials.

TI The potential for salmon fibrin and thrombin to mitigate pain subsequent
   to cervical nerve root injury
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Nerve root compression is a common cause of radiculopathy and induces persistent pain. Mammalian fibrin is used clinically as a coagulant but presents a variety of risks. Fish fibrin is a potential biomaterial for neural injury treatment because it promotes neurite outgrowth, is non-toxic, and clots readily at lower temperatures. This study administered salmon fibrin and thrombin following nerve root compression and measured behavioral sensitivity and glial activation in a rat pain model. Fibrin and thrombin each significantly reduced mechanical allodynia compared to injury alone (p < 0.02). Painful compression with fibrin exhibited allodynia that was not different from sham for any day using stimulation by a 2 g filament; allodynia was only significantly different (p < 0.043) from sham using the 4 g filament on days 1 and 3. By day 5, responses for fibrin treatment decreased to sham levels. Allodynia following compression with thrombin treatment were unchanged from sham at any time point. Macrophage infiltration at the nerve root and spinal microglial activation were only mildly modified by salmon treatments. Spinal astrocytic expression decreased significantly with fibrin (p < 0.0001) but was unchanged from injury responses for thrombin treatment. Results suggest that salmon fibrin and thrombin may be suitable biomaterials to mitigate pain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A phenomenological mixture model for biosynthesis and linking of
   cartilage extracellular matrix in scaffolds seeded with chondrocytes
SO BIOMECHANICS AND MODELING IN MECHANOBIOLOGY
AB A phenomenological mixture model is presented for interactions between biosynthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents and ECM linking in a scaffold seeded with chondrocytes. A system of three ordinary differential equations for average apparent densities of unlinked ECM, linked ECM and scaffold is developed along with associated initial conditions for scaffold material properties. Equations for unlinked ECM synthesis and ECM linking include an inhibitory mechanism where associated rates decrease as unlinked ECM concentration in the interstitial fluid increases. Linking rates are proposed to depend on average porosity in the evolving tissue construct. The resulting initial value problem contains nine independent parameters that account for scaffold biomaterial properties and interacting mechanisms in the engineered system. Effects of parameter variations on model variables are analyzed relative to a baseline case with emphasis on the evolution of solid phase apparent density, which is often correlated with the compressive elastic modulus of the tissue construct. The new model provides an additional quantitative framework for assessing and optimizing the design of engineered cell-scaffold systems and guiding strategies for articular cartilage tissue engineering.

TI Evaluation of pH at the Bacteria-Dental Cement Interface
SO JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH
AB Physiochemical assessment of the parasite-biomaterial interface is essential in the development of new biomaterials. The purpose of this study was to develop a method to evaluate pH at the bacteriadental cement interface and to demonstrate physiochemical interaction at the interface. The experimental apparatus with a well (4.0 mm in diameter and 2.0 mm deep) was made of polymethyl methacrylate with dental cement or polymethyl methacrylate (control) at the bottom. Three representative dental cements (glass-ionomer, zinc phosphate, and zinc oxide-eugenol cements) were used. Each specimen was immersed in 2 mM potassium phosphate buffer for 10 min, 24 hrs, 1 wk, or 4 wks. The well was packed with Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449, and a miniature pH electrode was placed at the interface between bacterial cells and dental cement. The pH was monitored after the addition of 1% glucose, and the fluoride contained in the cells was quantified. Glass-ionomer cement inhibited the bacteria-induced pH fall significantly compared with polymethyl methacrylate (control) at the interface (10 min, 5.16 +/- 0.19 vs. 4.50 +/- 0.07; 24 hrs, 5.20 +/- 0.07 vs. 4.59 +/- 0.11; 1 wk, 5.34 +/- 0.14 vs. 4.57 +/- 0.11; and 4 wks, 4.95 +/- 0.27 vs. 4.40 +/- 0.14), probably due to the fluoride released from the cement. This method could be useful for the assessment of pH at the parasite-biomaterial interface.

TI Thermal Treatments Modulate Bacterial Adhesion to Dental Enamel
SO JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH
AB Numerous studies have demonstrated the effects of laser-induced heat on demineralization of enamel; however, no studies have investigated the link between heat/laser-induced changes in physicochemical properties and bacterial adhesion. In this study, we investigated the effects of thermal treatment on surface properties of enamel such as hydrophobicity and zeta potential. Bacterial adhesion to treated surfaces was characterized by confocal laser scanning microscopy, and adhesion force was quantified by atomic force microscopy. The hydrophobicity of enamel increased after heating (p < 0.05), and the zeta potential of heated enamel became more negative than that of the control (p < 0.01). Streptococcus oralis and S. mitis were more hydrophilic than S. sanguis, with more negative zeta potential (all p < 0.01). S. mitis and S. oralis occupied significantly less area on enamel after being heated (p < 0.05). Heating reduced the adhesion force of both S. mitis and S. oralis to enamel with or without saliva coating. Reduction of adhesion force was statistically significant for S. mitis (p < 0.01), whereas that of S. oralis was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Heating did not affect the adhesion of S. sanguis with or without saliva coating. In conclusion, thermal treatment and photothermal/laser treatments may modulate the physicochemical properties of enamel, preventing the adhesion of some bacterial species.

TI The impact of dendrimer-grafted modifications to model silicon surfaces
   on protein adsorption and bacterial adhesion
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB In the oral cavity, omnipresent salivary protein films (pellicle) mediate bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on natural tissues as well as on artificial implant surfaces, which may cause serious infectious diseases like periimplantitis. The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the adsorption/desorption behaviour of human saliva on model surfaces grafted with polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer molecules compared to self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) exhibiting the same terminal functions (-NH2, -COOH) by two complementary analytical methods. Furthermore, the role of saliva conditioning of PAMAM and analogous SAM modifications on the adhesion of Streptococcus gordonii DL1, an early oral colonizer, was investigated. In contrast to SAMs. PAMAM-grafted surfaces showed reduced streptococcal adherence in the absence of pre-adsorbed saliva similar to the level obtained for poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) coatings. Moreover, coatings of PAMAM-NH2 maintained their bacteria-repellent behaviour even after saliva-conditioning. As a general outcome, it was found that lower amounts of protein adsorbed on PAMAM coatings than on analogous SAMs. Since this study demonstrates that covalently bound PAMAM dendrimers can modulate the oral bacterial response, this approach has significant potential for the development of anti-adhesive biomaterial surfaces that are conditioned with proteinaceous films.

TI Periodontal regeneration using a bilayered PLGA/calcium phosphate
   construct
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The regeneration of tissues affected by periodontal disease is a complex process; it encompasses the formation of bone, cementum and periodontal ligament. We developed a semi-rigid PLGA (polylactide-co-glycolide acid)/CaP (calcium phosphate) bilayered biomaterial construct to promote periodontal regeneration, which has a continuous outer barrier membrane and an inner topographically complex component. Our experimental model compared periodontal prophylaxis alone with prophylaxis and biomaterial implantation in the treatment of class II furcation defects in dogs. Clinical evaluation, micro-computed tomography, histology and backscattered electron imaging were used for data analysis. Healing occurred uneventfully and bone volumetric values, trabecular number and trabecular thickness were all significantly greater in the treated group; while trabecular separation was significantly greater in the control group. New cementum, bone, and periodontal ligament with Sharpey fibre insertions were only seen in the treated group. Although periodontal regeneration has been reported elsewhere, the advantages of employing our bilayered PLGA + CaP construct are twofold: 1)it did not collapse into the defect; and, 2) its inner side was able to retain the blood clot throughout the buccal defect. The result was greater periodontal regeneration than has previously been reported with traditional flexible membranes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The amelioration of cardiac dysfunction after myocardial infarction by
   the injection of keratin biomaterials derived from human hair
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Cardiac dysfunction following acute myocardial infarction is a major cause of advanced cardiomyopathy. Conventional pharmacological therapies rely on prompt reperfusion and prevention of repetitive maladaptive pathways. Keratin biomaterials can be manufactured in an autologous fashion and are effective in various models of tissue regeneration. However, its potential application in cardiac regeneration has not been tested. Keratin biomaterials were derived from human hair and its structure morphology, carryover of beneficial factors, biocompatibility with cardiomyocytes, and in vivo degradation profile were characterized. After delivery into infarcted rat hearts, the keratin scaffolds were efficiently infiltrated by cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. Injection of keratin biomaterials promotes angiogenesis but does not exacerbate inflammation in the post-MI hearts. Compared to control-injected animals, keratin biomaterials-injected animals exhibited preservation of cardiac function and attenuation of adverse ventricular remodeling over the 8 week following time course. Tissue western blot analysis revealed up-regulation of beneficial factors (BMP4, NGF, TGF-beta) in the keratin-injected hearts. The salient functional benefits, the simplicity of manufacturing and the potentially autologous nature of this biomaterial provide impetus for further translation to the clinic.

TI Real time monitoring of biomaterial-mediated inflammatory responses via
   macrophage-targeting NIR nanoprobes
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Medical implant-mediated inflammatory responses, often involving high levels of macrophages, are typically determined by histological analyses. These methods however are time consuming and require many animals to monitor the kinetics of inflammatory reactions and to generate reproducible outcomes. Recent studies have shown that activated macrophages in inflamed tissue express high levels of folate receptor (FR). In this study, FR-targeting NIR nanoprobes were fabricated and then tested for their ability to detect and quantify the extent of biomaterial-mediated inflammatory responses in vivo. Indeed, FR-targeting nanoprobes preferentially accumulate on activated macrophage surfaces. When administered intravenously, we found that the FR-targeting nanoprobes distinctively gathered in the inflamed tissues and that a different extent of FR-targeting nanoprobe gathering could be found in tissues implanted with different types of biomaterials. Most importantly, we found that there was a good relationship between the extent of inflammatory reactions and the intensity of nanoprobe-associated NIR signal in tissue. Our results support that FR-targeting NIR nanoprobes can be used to monitor and quantify the extent of macrophage recruitment and the degree of an implants' biocompatibility in real time.

TI The use of injectable sonication-induced silk hydrogel for VEGF(165) and
   BMP-2 delivery for elevation of the maxillary sinus floor
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Sonication-induced silk hydrogels were previously prepared as an injectable bone replacement biomaterial, with a need to improve osteogenic features. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF(165)) and bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) are key regulators of angiogenesis and osteogenesis, respectively, during bone regeneration. Therefore, the present study aimed at evaluating in situ forming silk hydrogels as a vehicle to encapsulate dual factors for rabbit maxillary sinus floor augmentation. Sonication-induced silk hydrogels were prepared in vitro and the slow release of VEGF(165) and BMP-2 from these silk gels was evaluated by ELISA. For in vivo studies for each time point (4 and 12 weeks), 24 sinus floors elevation surgeries were made bilaterally in 12 rabbits for the following four treatment groups: silk gel (group Silk gel), silk gel/VEGF(165) (group VEGF), silk gel/BMP-2 (group BMP-2), silk gel/VEGF(165)/BMP-2 (group V + B) (n = 6 per group). Sequential florescent labeling and radiographic observations were used to record new bone formation and mineralization, along with histological and histomorphometric analysis. At week 4, VEGF(165) promoted more tissue infiltration into the gel and accelerated the degradation of the gel material. At this time point, the bone area in group V + B was significantly larger than those in the other three groups. At week 12, elevated sinus floor heights of groups BMP-2 and V + B were larger than those of the Silk gel and VEGF groups, and the V + B group had the largest new bone area among all groups. In addition, a larger blood vessel area formed in the remaining gel areas in groups VEGF and V + B. In conclusion, VEGF(165) and BMP-2 released from injectable and biodegradable silk gels promoted angiogenesis and new bone formation, with the two factors demonstrating an additive effect on bone regeneration. These results indicate that silk hydrogels can be used as an injectable vehicle to deliver multiple growth factors in a minimally invasive approach to regenerate irregular bony cavities.

TI Beneficial effects of hydrocortisone or spironolactone coating on
   foreign body response to mesh biomaterial in a mouse model
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Prosthetic reinforcements markedly reduce the risk of hernia recurrence. However, the implantation of meshes is related to an inflammatory foreign body reaction (FBR) with serious complications (i.e., persistent seroma, wound infection, mesh migration, entrapment, chronic pain). Adrenal hormones profoundly modify inflammatory response. Their effects on FBR however, remain ill defined. We therefore studied the FBR to polyvinylidenfluoride (PVDF) mesh material that was coated with four different substances: hydrocortisone (COR) or mifepristone (MIF), which respectively stimulate and block the glucocorticoid receptor, and aldosterone (ALD) or spironolactone (SPI), which respectively stimulate and block the mineralocorticoid receptor. The coated substances were released from the meshes within 24 h. Seven, 21, and 90 days after implantation, the specimen was evaluated for collagen formation, granuloma size, inflammatory activity, and angiogenesis. COR and SPI coating protected from inflammatory response, while ALD and MIF coating showed little difference to the control group. The COR and SPI groups showed smaller granuloma sizes at all time points, as well as a reduced number of inflammatory cells (p < 0.001) at day 90, and decreased collagen formation starting after 21 days (p < 0.05). There was a negative correlation for angiogenesis with inflammation around foreign body structures. In summary, these results suggest that early and temporary stimulation of the glucocorticoid receptor or blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor have beneficial effects on FBR in the long term.

TI Effect of surface chemistry on bacterial adhesion, viability, and
   morphology
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is one of the most common infectious agents in the world and it is thought to colonize the gastric mucosa of about half of the world's population causing several gastric diseases. In this work, the effect of surface chemistry on H. pylori nonspecific adhesion, viability, and morphology was evaluated using three H. pylori strains with different adhesins expression profile. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols on gold were used to obtain surfaces exposing different functional groups: OH, CH3, and ethylene glycol (EG4). Bacterial adhesion onto the surfaces reached a plateau at 2 h. There was a correlation between adhesion and the exposed surface group, with bacterial cells adhering preferentially to CH3-SAMs while EG4-SAMs prevented H. pylori adhesion during the entire adhesion test (24 h). Surfaces that presented the EG4 group were also the only ones that significantly reduced the viability of adhered bacteria. Surface chemistry also influenced the morphology of adhered bacteria. The H. pylori rod shape observed in the control (Tissue Culture Polyethylene-TCPE) was only retrieved on CH3-SAMs. This work demonstrates that surface chemistry, namely specific functional groups on the material, influence the nonspecific adsorption of H. pylori. Moreover, the features of the bacterial strain and the surface chemistry can alter the adhesion kinetics, as well as the morphology and viability of attached bacteria.

TI Human amniotic membrane as a chondrocyte carrier vehicle/substrate: In
   vitro study
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Human amniotic membrane (HAM) is an established biomaterial used in many clinical applications. However, its use for tissue engineering purposes has not been fully realized. A study was therefore conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using HAM as a chondrocyte substrate/carrier. HAMs were obtained from fresh human placenta and were process to produced air dried HAM (AdHAM) and freeze dried HAM (FdHAM). Rabbit chondrocytes were isolated and expanded in vitro and seeded onto these preparations. Cell proliferation, GAG expression and GAG/cell expression were measured at days 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 21, and 28. These were compared to chondrocytes seeded onto plastic surfaces. Histological analysis and scanning electron microscopy was performed to observe cell attachment. There was significantly higher cell proliferation rates observed between AdHAM (13-51%, P=0.001) or FdHAM (18-48%, p=0.001) to chondrocytes in monolayer. Similarly, GAG and GAG/cell expressed in AdHAM (33-82%, p=0.001; 22-60%, p=0.001) or FdHAM (41-81%, p=0.001: 28-60%, p=0.001) were significantly higher than monolayer cultures. However, no significant differences were observed in the proliferation rates (p=0.576), GAG expression (p=0.476) and GAG/cell expression (p=0.135) between AdHAM and FdHAM. The histology and scanning electron microscopy assessments demonstrates good chondrocyte attachments on both HAMs. In conclusion, both AdHAM and FdHAM provide superior chondrocyte proliferation, GAG expression, and attachment than monolayer cultures making it a potential substrate/carrier for cell based cartilage therapy and transplantation.

TI Hydrogel design for cartilage tissue engineering: A case study with
   hyaluronic acid
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Hyaline cartilage serves as a low-friction and wear-resistant articulating surface in load-bearing, diarthrodial joints. Unfortunately, as the avascular, alymphatic nature of cartilage significantly impedes the body's natural ability to regenerate, damage resulting from trauma and osteoarthritis necessitates repair attempts. Current clinical methods are generally limited in their ability to regenerate functional cartilage, and so research in recent years has focused on tissue engineering solutions in which the regeneration of cartilage is pursued through combinations of cells (e.g., chondrocytes or stem cells) paired with scaffolds (e.g., hydrogels, sponges, and meshes) in conjunction with stimulatory growth factors and bioreactors. A variety of synthetic and natural materials have been employed, most commonly in the form of hydrogels, and these systems have been tuned for optimal nutrient diffusion, connectivity of deposited matrix, degradation, soluble factor delivery, and mechanical loading for enhanced matrix production and organization. Even with these promising advances, the complex mechanical properties and biochemical composition of native cartilage have not been achieved, and engineering cartilage tissue still remains a significant challenge. Using hyaluronic acid hydrogels as an example, this review will follow the progress of material design specific to cartilage tissue engineering and propose possible future directions for the field.

It also provides a platform to study scaffold-cell and cell cell interactions. The scaffold affects the growth and morphology of cells growing on it, and concomitantly, cells affect the properties of the resultant tissue construct. Silk fibroin protein from Antheraea mylitta, a non-mulberry Indian tropical tasar silkworm, is a potential biomaterial for diverse applications due to its widespread versatility as a mechanically robust, biocompatible, tissue engineering material. Analysis of silk fibroin scaffolds seeded with varying initial densities (25, 50 and 100 million cells/ml) and cultured for 2 weeks showed that thickness and wet weight increased by 60-70% for the highest cell density, and DNA, GAG and collagen content of the cartilaginous constructs increased with increasing cell density. Mechanical characterization of the constructs elucidated that the highest density constructs had compressive stiffness and modulus 4-5 times that of cell-free scaffolds. The present results indicate the importance of cell seeding density in the rapid formation of a functional cartilaginous tissue. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Growth promoting substrates for human dermal fibroblasts provided by
   artificial extracellular matrices composed of collagen I and sulfated
   glycosaminoglycans
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The application of native extracellular matrix (ECM) components is a promising approach for biomaterial design. Here, we investigated artificial ECM (aECM) consisting of collagen I (coll) and the glycosaminoglycans (GAGS) hyaluronan (HA) or chondroitin sulfate (CS). Additionally, GAGs were chemically modified by the introduction of sulfate groups to obtain low-sulfated and high-sulfated GAG derivatives. Sulfate groups are expected to bind and concentrate growth factors and improve their bioactivity. In this study we analyzed the effect of aECM on initial adhesion, proliferation, ECM synthesis and differentiation of human dermal fibroblasts (dFb) within 8-48 h. We show that initial adhesion and cell proliferation of dFb progressively increased in a sulfate dependent manner. In contrast, synthesis of ECM components coil and HA was decreased on high-sulfated aECM coll/HA3.0 and coll/CS3.1. Furthermore, the matrix metallo-proteinase-1 (MMP-1) was down-regulated on coll/HA3.0 and coll/CS3.1 on mRNA and protein level. The fibroblast differentiation marker a-smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA) is not affected by aECM on mRNA level. Artificial ECM consisting of coil and high-sulfated GAGs proves to be a suitable biomaterial for dFb adhesion and proliferation that induces a "proliferative phenotype" of dFb found in the early stages of cutaneous wound healing.

TI Promotion of osteoblast differentiation in 3D biomaterial micro-chip
   arrays comprising fibronectin-coated poly(methyl methacrylate)
   polycarbonate
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Due to the architecture of solid body tissues including bone, three-dimensional (3D) in vitro microenvironments appear favorable, since herein cell growth proceeds under more physiological conditions compared to conventional 2D systems. In the present study we show that a 3D microenvironment comprising a fibronectin-coated PMMA/PC-based micro-chip promotes differentiation of primary human osteoblasts as reflected by the densely-packed 3D bone cell aggregates and expression of biomarkers indicating osteoblast differentiation. Morphogenesis and fluorescence dye-based live/dead staining revealed homogenous cell coverage of the microcavities of the chip array, whereat cells showed high viability up to 14 days. Moreover. Azur II staining proved formation of uniform sized multilayered aggregates, exhibiting progressive intracellular deposition of extracellular bone matrix constituents comprising fibronectin, osteocalcin and osteonectin from day 7 on. Compared to 2D monolayers, osteoblasts grown in the 3D chip environment displayed differential mostly higher gene expression for osteocalcin, osteonectin, and alkaline phosphatase, while collagen type I remained fairly constant in both culture environments. Our results indicate that the 3D microenvironment, based on the PMMA biomaterial chip array promotes osteoblast differentiation, and hereby renders a promising tool for tissue-specific in vitro preconditioning of osteoblasts designated for clinically-oriented bone augmentation or regeneration.

TI The influence of elasticity and surface roughness on myogenic and
   osteogenic-differentiation of cells on silk-elastin biomaterials
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The interactions of C2C12 myoblasts and human bone marrow stem cells (hMSCs) with silk-tropoelastin biomaterials, and the capacity of each to promote attachment, proliferation, and either myogenic- or osteogenic-differentiation were investigated. Temperature-controlled water vapor annealing was used to control beta-sheet crystal formation to generate insoluble silk-tropoelastin biomaterial matrices at defined ratios of the two proteins. These ratios controlled surface roughness and micro/nano-scale topological patterns, and elastic modulus, stiffness, yield stress, and tensile strength. A combination of low surface roughness and high stiffness in the silk-tropoelastin materials promoted proliferation and myogenic-differentiation of C2C12 cells. In contrast, high surface roughness with micro/nano-scale surface patterns was favored by hMSCs. Increasing the content of human tropoelastin in the silk-tropoelastin materials enhanced the proliferation and osteogenic-differentiation of hMSCs. We conclude that the silk-tropoelastin composition facilitates fine tuning of the growth and differentiation of these cells. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Microstructures and mechanical properties of
   titanium/biodegradable-polymer FGM for bone tissue fabricated by spark
   plasma sintering method
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB Ti and Ti alloys are widely used as metallic implants, because of their good mechanical properties and nontoxic behavior. However, they have problems as the implant-materials, namely, high Young's modulus comparing that of bone and low bonding ability with bone. There is a need to develop the Ti and Ti alloys with lower Young's modulus and good bonding ability. In previous study, Ti composite containing biodegradable poly-L-lactic-acid (PLLA) fiber has been fabricated to improve these problems. However, this composite has low strength because of the imperfect sintering of Ti matrix. To improve its strength, sintering of Ti matrix should be completed. In this study, Ti-NaCl composite material was fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS) method using powder mixture of Ti and NaCl to complete the sintering of Ti matrix. To obtain porous Ti samples, Ti-NaCl composite were put into hot water of 317 K. The porous Ti was dipped into PLLA melt in order to introduce PLLA into the pores of porous Ti. Finally, Ti/PLLA composite was obtained, and PLLA plays a role as reinforcement of Ti matrix. It was found that the Ti/PLLA composite has gradient structure and mechanical properties.

SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Titanium-10 wt.% 4555 Bioglass scaffold nanocomposites were synthesized by the combination of mechanical alloying and by a "space-holder" sintering process. The porous structure and corrosion properties were investigated. In vitro biocompatibility of these materials was evaluated and compared with a conventional microcrystalline titanium, where normal human osteoblast (NHOst) cells from Cambrex (CC-2538) were cultured on the disks of the materials and cell growth was examined. The morphology of the cell cultures obtained on Ti-10 wt.% 45S5 Bioglass nanocomposite was similar to those obtained on the microcrystalline titanium. On the other hand, on porous scaffold, the cells adhered with their whole surface to the insert penetrating the porous structure, while on the polished surface, more spherical cells were observed with a smaller surface of adhesion. The present study has demonstrated that titanium-10 wt.% 4555 Bioglass scaffold nanocomposite is a promising biomaterial for bone tissue engineering. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,

SO IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH
AB DB is a whitish to yellowish resin, characterized initially in terms of solubility, acid value, molecular weight (M(w)), polydispersity index (M(w)/M(n)) and glass transition temperature (T(g)). Neat plasticized films of DB (Damar Bath) are investigated for mechanical, water vapor transmission and moisture absorption properties. To improve the mechanical properties of the free films dibutyl sebacate, a hydrophobic plasticizer was added to film composition. The biomaterial was further investigated for sustaining the drug release from spherical units (multiparticulates). The core of pellet was prepared using Diclofenac sodium (10% w/w) as a model drug by extrusion and speronization. The drug containing pellets were coated using DB plasticized film-coating solutions.
   With 2% coat build-up, sustained drug release up to 10 h was achieved with coating solution containing 20% and 30% w/w (based on DB weight) plasticizers. Less than 3% drug was released in the first 2 h which may be explained in terms of the insolubility of DB and the drug in acidic milieu. The release from pellets coated using DB film coating solution containing 20% and 30% plasticizers followed first order release pattern. DB seems to be a promising film former for pharmaceutical coating due to its reasonably good mechanical properties, low water vapor transmission and sustained release capability.

TI Enhancement of the fraction of the active form of an antitumor drug
   topotecan via an injectable hydrogel
SO JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE
AB Poly(D, L-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(D, L-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) hydrogels were tried as implants to encapsulate antitumor drug topotecan (TPT), a derivative of camptothecin (CPT). Despite of water solubility of TPT, the in vitro release of this low-molecular-weight drug from hydrogels sustained for 5 days with only a mild initial burst. The antitumor efficacy of the released TPT was further validated in S180-bearing mice. Surprisingly, the fraction of the active lactone form of TPT was increased to above 50% in the hydrogel matrix, while the fraction was just about 10% in phosphate buffer saline under physiological pH at 37 degrees C. This significant effect was interpreted not by the local acidic pH within the hydrogel, but by the increase of pKa of the carboxylate group of the open-ring form due to the hydrophobic interaction between the amphiphilic polymer and TPT. Theoretical analysis via a pKa-related mechanism was also performed, which was consistent with our experimental measurements. Hence, this study has revealed that an appropriate biomaterial could, via drug-material interactions, enhance the drug efficacy by increasing the active fraction of some drugs which exhibit a reversible conversion between the active and inactive structures.

AB In this article, silk fibroin particles with average diameter of 980 nm were fabricated via self assembly. Exceptional loading efficiency and release patterns of hydrophobic and protein drugs were observed. Furthermore, smoother release patterns were observed with increase loading of the hydrophobic and protein model drugs, only about 23% FITC-BSA and 34% RhB were released from the silk particles at their highest corresponding loading in 50 days. Most importantly, osteoblasts' viability was augmented during co-culture with silk fibroin particles, as shown by Alamar Blue assay. Attachment of the particles and delivery of model drugs to cells were confirmed by fluorescence images and flow cytometry. Hence, the silk fibroin particles could be potential biomaterial for application in controlled release and pharmaceutics. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), which is a durable biomaterial because of its excellent biological inertness, is now widely used for prostheses in clinical medicine. However, conversely, the inert nature of ePTFE results in poor adaptability to the surrounding tissue due to lack of a cell-adhesive property. In this study, the surface of ePTFE was modified with ion beam irradiation to improve the blood compatibility. The surface modification of ePTFE sheets by He(+) Ne(+), Ar(+) and Kr(+) ion beams was performed at an energy of 150 keV with fluences of 1 x 10(14), 5 x 10(14) and 1 x 10(15) ions/cm(2). To investigate anti-thrombogenicity, Ca(2+)-replenished platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was placed in contact with the surfaces for 10 min. Compared to the non-modified ePTFE surface, platelet response was inhibited on the surfaces modified with He(+), Ne(+) and Ar(+): 5 x 10(14) and 1 x 10(15) ions/cm(2), and Kr(+): 5 x 10(14) ions/cm(2); however, platelet response was promoted on the surfaces modified with He(+), Ne(+) and Ar(+): 1 x 10(14) ions/cm(2), and Kr(+): 1 x 10(14) and 1 x 10(15) ions/cm(2). The significant morphological changes in ePTFE surface associated with ion beam modification are thought to be one of the reasons for the inhibition of platelet response. Endothelial cells were cultured on the surfaces for 3 days to evaluate the cellular response. Endothelial cell growth was significantly promoted on all of the surfaces of ion beam-modified ePTFE, although the non-modified ePTFE surface dramatically inhibited this growth. It is concluded that ion beam modification of ePTFE surface can improve the blood compatibility through not only the promotion of endothelial cell growth but also the inhibition of platelet response.

AB Collagen, which is widely used as a biomaterial because of its excellent tissue compatibility, is generally extracted from animal tissues. The animal-derived biomaterials have the potential for viral or infectious agent contamination risks and allergic reaction problems. Therefore, this study focused on a recombinant human collagen which was pure and homogeneous, compared to the collagen derived from animals. Recombinant human type I collagen was modified by using an ion beam to control the biocompatibility for the substrates of medical devices. He(+) ion beam irradiation of the recombinant collagen was performed at an energy of 150 keV with fluences of 1 x 10(13), 1 x 10(14) and 1 x 10(15) ions/cm(2). To investigate anti-thrombogenicity, Ca(2+)-replenished platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was placed in contact with the surfaces for 5 min. Platelet response was significantly inhibited at a fluence of 1 x 10(14) ions/cm(2), although the surfaces of the non-modification and other fluences promoted this response. Endothelial cells were cultured on the surfaces for 4 days to evaluate the cellular response. The cell-adhesive property of the recombinant collagen still remained at the fluences of 1 x 10(14) ions/cm(2) or less; however, the surface modified with a fluence of 1 x 10(15) ions/cm(2) dramatically inhibited the cell adhesion. These results suggest that platelet and cell adhesion onto the recombinant collagen surface can be individually controlled by the fluence of 150 keV He(+) ion beam modification. It is concluded that the recombinant collagen surface modified with a fluence of 1 x 10(14) ions/cm(2) not only retains cell-adhesive property but also possesses anti-thrombogenicity.

TI Thermally Triggered Assembly of Cationic Graft Copolymers Containing
   2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethyl Methacrylate Side Chains
SO LANGMUIR
AB Thermoresponsive copolymers continue to attract a great deal of interest in the literature. In particular, those based on ethylene oxide-containing methacrylates have excellent potential for biomaterial applications. Recently, some of us reported a study of thermoresponsive cationic graft copolymers containing poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), PNIPAm, (Liu et al., Langmuir, 24, 7099). Here, we report an improved version of this new family of copolymers. In the present study, we replaced the PNIPAm side chains with poly(2-(2-methyoxyethoxy)ethylmethacrylate), PMeO(2)MA. These new, nonacrylamide containing, cationic graft copolymers were prepared using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and a macroinitiator. They contained poly(trimethylamonium)-aminoethyl methacrylate and PMeO(2)MA, i.e., PTMA(x)(+)-g-(PMeO(2)MA(n))(y). They were investigated using variable-temperature turbidity, photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), electrophoretic mobility, and H-1 NMR measurements. For one system, four critical temperatures were measured and used to propose a mechanism for the thermally triggered changes that occur in solution. All of the copolymers existed as unimolecular micelles at 20 degrees C. They underwent reversible aggregation with heating. The extent of aggregation was controlled by the length of the side chains. TEM showed evidence of micellar aggregates. The thermally responsive behaviors of our new copolymers are compared to those for the cationic PNIPAm graft copolymers reported by Liu et al. Our new cationic copolymers retained their positive charge at all temperatures studied, have high zeta potentials at 37 degrees C, and are good candidates for conferring thermoresponsiveness to negatively charged biomaterial surfaces.

TI Defense role of the cocoon in the silk worm Bombyx mori L.
SO RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY
AB Silk from the domesticated silk worm Bombyx mori procures foreign body response naturally, so it has been utilized as a biomaterial for decades. In India the prime focus of the sericulture industry is to improve silk production with high quality silk. Naturally, the silk worm builds its cocoon not only with silk proteins, but also with antimicrobial proteins to avoid infection since the cocoon is non-motile and non-feeding. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the antimicrobial proteins that persist in the cocoon of the silk worm Bombyx mori. At the pupal stage, the silk worm cocoon shell extract was prepared from the day of pupation (P0) to the day of natural rupture of the cocoon for the eclosion of moth (NR). Using the cocoon shell extract a microbial susceptibility test was performed by the disc diffusion method against the microbes Escherchia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The development of a zone of inhibition against the microbes confirmed the presence of antimicrobial/immunogenic activity of the cocoon shell extract. For further analysis, the cocoon shell extract was subjected to 7-15% sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The protein profile of the cocoon extract revealed the coomassie blue stained bands resolved from the 150 - 15 kDa molecular range. Interestingly, a polypeptide localized at around 29 kDa showed remarkable expressional changes during the development of pupa. To characterize the 29 kDa protein, it was eluted from the gel, digested with trypsin and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The trypsin-digested peptide peaks were analyzed through MASCOT and peptides were matched with the NCBI nr database. The peptides were very well matched with the 18 wheeler protein, which is reported to be responsible for innate immunity, belonging to the Toll family in insects and responsible for cellular mediated immunity.

TI Novel use of biodegradable casein conduits for guided peripheral nerve
   regeneration
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
AB Recent advances in nerve repair technology have focused on finding more biocompatible, non-toxic materials to imitate natural peripheral nerve components. In this study, casein protein cross-linked with naturally occurring genipin (genipin-cross-linked casein (GCC)) was used for the first time to make a biodegradable conduit for peripheral nerve repair. The GCC conduit was dark blue in appearance with a concentric and round lumen. Water uptake, contact angle and mechanical tests indicated that the conduit had a high stability in water and did not collapse and cramped with a sufficiently high level of mechanical properties. Cytotoxic testing and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling assay showed that the GCC was non-toxic and non-apoptotic, which could maintain the survival and outgrowth of Schwann cells. Non-invasive real-time nuclear factor-kB bioluminescence imaging accompanied by histochemical assessment showed that the GCC was highly biocompatible after subcutaneous implantation in transgenic mice. Effectiveness of the GCC conduit as a guidance channel was examined as it was used to repair a 10 mm gap in the rat sciatic nerve. Electrophysiology, labelling of calcitonin gene-related peptide in the lumbar spinal cord, and histology analysis all showed a rapid morphological and functional recovery for the disrupted nerves. Therefore, we conclude that the GCC can offer great nerve regeneration characteristics and can be a promising material for the successful repair of peripheral nerve defects.

TI Osseointegration of porous titanium implants with and without
   electrochemically deposited DCPD coating in an ovine model
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH
AB Background: Uncemented fixation of components in joint arthroplasty is achieved primarily through de novo bone formation at the bone-implant interface and establishment of a biological and mechanical interlock. In order to enhance bone-implant integration osteoconductive coatings and the methods of application thereof are continuously being developed and applied to highly porous and roughened implant substrates. In this study the effects of an electrochemically-deposited dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) coating of a porous substrate on implant osseointegration was assessed using a standard uncemented implant fixation model in sheep.
   Methods: Plasma sprayed titanium implants with and without a DCPD coating were inserted into defects drilled into the cancellous and cortical sites of the femur and tibia. Cancellous implants were inserted in a press-fit scenario whilst cortical implants were inserted in a line-to-line fit. Specimens were retrieved at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks postoperatively. Interfacial shear-strength of the cortical sites was assessed using a push-out test, whilst bone ingrowth, ongrowth and remodelling were investigated using histologic and histomorphometric endpoints.
   Results: DCPD coating significantly improved cancellous bone ingrowth at 4 weeks but had no significant effect on mechanical stability in cortical bone up to 12 weeks postoperatively. Whilst a significant reduction in cancellous bone ongrowth was observed from 4 to 12 weeks for the DCPD coating, no other statistically significant differences in ongrowth or ingrowth in either the cancellous or cortical sites were observed between TiPS and DCPD groups.
   Conclusion: The application of a DCPD coating to porous titanium substrates may improve the extent of cancellous bone ingrowth in the early postoperative phase following uncemented arthroplasty.

TI pH-Switchable Optical Properties of the One-Dimensional Periodic Grating
   of Tethered Poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) Brushes on a Silicon
   Surface
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB In this paper we used a novel fabrication process, involving very-large-scale integration and oxygen plasma treatment, to generate well-defined patterns of polymerized (2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (DMAEMA) as a one-dimensional periodic relief grating on silicon surfaces. The resolutions of the line patterns of the PDMAEMA brushes approached 400 nm. We describe an aqueous-based process controlled at a one-dimensional periodic grating. The line patterns of PDMAEMA brushes could generate water contact angles (WCAs) and refractive indices for TM and TE polarization on the surface because of one-dimensional binary periodic relief grating. The effective refractive index for TM polarization could be tuned between 1.18 and 1.28 upon increasing the pH from 2 to 12. The effective refractive index for TE polarization of the optical grating increased rapidly from 1.28 to 1.38 upon increasing the pH from 2 to 12; it returned to 1.29 after decreasing pH from 12 to 2. These reversibly tunable properties are created from a reversible pH-induced swelling transition of tethered PDMAEMA. In addition, the filling factors of the periodic grating were calculated to illustrate the conformational changes of tethered PDMAEMA in the binary grating. Such films, easily patterned by an inkjet printing technique, possess potential for pH-responsive biomaterial and membrane applications.

TI Effect of Orotic Acid on the Crystallization Kinetics and Morphology of
   Biodegradable Poly(L-lactide) as an Efficient Nucleating Agent
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB The wider practical application of biodegradable and biocompatible poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) has been restricted because of many disadvantages, especially its relatively slow crystallization rate. In this note, a PLLA/orotic acid (OA) composite was prepared via a simple melt compounding method. It is found that both the nonisothermal melt crystallization and overall isothermal melt crystallization kinetics of PLLA have been enhanced significantly in the composite, even at very low OA content, relative to that of neat PLLA, indicating that OA is an efficient nucleating agent of PLLA for its wider practical application, especially as biomaterial.

TI Enhanced mechanical properties and in vitro corrosion behavior of
   amorphous and devitrified Ti40Zr10Cu38Pd12 metallic glass
SO JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS
AB The effects of annealing treatments on the microstructure, elastic/mechanical properties, wear resistance and corrosion behavior of rod-shaped Ti40Zr10Cu38Pd12 bulk glassy alloys, synthesized by copper mold casting, are investigated. Formation of ultrafine crystals embedded in an amorphous matrix is observed for intermediate annealing temperatures, whereas a fully crystalline microstructure develops after heating to sufficiently high temperatures. The glassy alloy exhibits large hardness, relatively low Young's modulus, good wear resistance and excellent corrosion behavior. Nanoindentation measurements reveal that the sample annealed in the supercooled liquid region exhibits a hardness value of 9.4 GPa, which is 20% larger than in the completely amorphous state and much larger than the hardness of commercial Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The Young's modulus of the as-cast alloy (around 100 GPa, as determined from acoustic measurements) increases only slightly during partial devitrification. Finally, the anticorrosion performance of the Ti40Zr10Cu38Pd12 alloy in Hank's solution has been shown to ameliorate as crystallization proceeds and is roughly as good as in the commercial Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The outstanding mechanical and corrosion properties of the Ti40Zr10Cu38Pd12 alloy, both in amorphous and crystalline states, are appealing for its use in biomedical applications.

TI Manipulation of mechanical compliance of elastomeric PGS by
   incorporation of halloysite nanotubes for soft tissue engineering
   applications
SO JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS
AB Poly (glycerol sebacate) (PGS) is a promising elastomer for use in soft tissue engineering. However, it is difficult to achieve with PGS a satisfactory balance of mechanical compliance and degradation rate that meet the requirements of soft tissue engineering. In this work, we have synthesised a new PGS nanocomposite system filled with halloysite nanotubes, and mechanical properties, as well as related chemical characters, of the nanocomposites were investigated. It was found that the addition of nanotubular halloysite did not compromise the extensibility of material, compared with the pure PGS counterpart; instead the elongation at rupture was increased from 110 (in the pure PGS) to 225% (in the 20 wt% composite). Second, Young's modulus and resilience of 3-5 wt% composites were similar to 0.8 MPa and >94% respectively, remaining close to the level of pure PGS which is desired for applications in soft tissue engineering. Third, an important feature of the 1-5 wt% composites was their stable mechanical properties over an extended period, which could allow the provision of reliable mechanical support to damaged tissues during the lag phase of the healing process. Finally, the in vitro study indicated that the addition of halloysite slowed down the degradation rate of the composites. In conclusion, the good compliance, enhanced stretchability, stable mechanical behavior over an extended period, and reduced degradation rates make the 3-5 wt% composites promising candidates for application in soft tissue engineering.

TI Surface integrity of biodegradable Magnesium-Calcium orthopedic implant
   by burnishing
SO JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS
AB Magnesium-Calcium (MgCa) alloy as an emerging biodegradable implant material has received considerable attention in orthopedic fixation applications. The biodegradable MgCa alloys avoid stress shielding and secondary surgery inherent with permanent metallic implant materials. They also provide sufficient mechanical strength in load carrying applications as opposed to biopolymers. However, the key issue facing a biodegradable MgCa implant is the fast corrosion in the human body environment. The ability to adjust the degradation rate of MgCa alloys is critical in the successful development of biodegradable orthopedic materials. Burnishing as a low plastic deformation process is a promising technique to tune surface integrity of MgCa implant surface for biodegradation control. However, the poor ductility of MgCa alloys imposes a great challenge for burnishing. This study focuses on the basic understanding of surface mechanical behavior of burnished biodegradable MgCa0.8 (wt%) alloy. The effects of burnishing parameters, i.e., pressure, feed, speed, number of path, and burnishing pattern on surface integrity factors such as surface topography, roughness, microhardness, microstructure, and residual stresses are investigated. The burnished surfaces are shinier and smoother than the as-machined ones. The MgCa alloy can be safely burnished at suitable burnishing conditions since no cracks are produced at the surface and in the subsurface. The microstructure including grain size does not show a noticeable change after burnishing. The machined surfaces are harder than the burnished ones down to the deep subsurface (similar to 200 mu m) as opposed to the shallow hardened depth (similar to 50 mu m) in cutting. Residual stresses are highly compressive especially at low burnishing pressure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Investigating a novel nanostructured fibrin-agarose biomaterial for
   human cornea tissue engineering: Rheological properties
SO JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS
AB In this work, the rheological properties of the biomaterial fibrin with different agarose concentrations, used for the generation of a bioengineered human corneal stroma by tissue engineering, before and after using a nanostructuring technique, were analyzed. The transparency of these artificial human stromas was also investigated. The temporal evaluation of the properties of these biomaterials is essential for the design of functional biological human corneal replacements. The nanostructuring technique used for the generation of nanostructured corneal constructs (NCCs) had a major influence on the rheological properties of the fibrin-agarose corneal equivalents. For an oscillatory shear stress of 1 Hz, well in the order of the natural oscillations of the human cornea, the NCCs had viscoelasticity values higher than those of non-nanostructured corneal constructs (N-NCCs), but similar to those of an ex vivo native cornea. The model that most resembled the rheological behavior of the native cornea was a fibrin-0.1% agarose concentration nanostructured construct. In addition, this artificial cornea model displayed optimal levels of transparency, similar to the native tissue. All these properties indicate that the fibrin-0.1% agarose concentration nanostructured construct might serve as an adequate candidate for the generation of an artificial complete cornea, not only for transplanting use but also for conducting pharmaceutical testing and biomedical research.

TI Nanostructural investigation of frontalis sling biomaterial surfaces
SO SCANNING
AB This study examined the nanostructural surface of three frontalis sling biomaterials: autogenous fascia lata, preserved fascia lata and silicone rod. The morphological characteristics of the sling biomaterial surfaces were examined qualitatively and quantitatively by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, respectively. The autogenous fascia lata showed well-arranged nanostructures of parallel fascia collagen fibrils with clear 67 nm axial periodicity, whereas the preserved fascia lata showed tangled nanostructures of damaged collagen fibril bundles. The silicone rod showed a substantial amount of debris with some scratches and the smoothest roughness compared with the other sling biomaterials, followed by preserved fascia lata. Autogenous fascia lata showed the highest surface roughness. The association between the roughness and cell adhesion suggests that the nanostructure of autogenous fascia lata biomaterials is the best for frontalis sling and that of the silicone rod biomaterials is the worst.

TI Vasoactive Properties of Keratin-Derived Compounds
SO MICROCIRCULATION
AB Objective: Keratin proteins have been utilized as biomaterials for decades, and are currently under investigation for a variety of tissue regeneration and trauma applications. It has been suggested that certain keratins may have the capacity to act as a colloid in fluid resuscitation applications, providing viscosity and oncotic properties that may be beneficial during acute ischemic events. Oxidized keratin derivatives, also known as keratoses, show good blood and cardiovascular compatibility and thus are the subject of this study.
   Methods: The effects of keratose compounds will be assessed using a topload i.v. infusion model and observation of changes in the microvasculature of the cremaster muscle of rats.
   Results: Keratose resuscitation fluid (KRF) administration resulted in significant vasodilation in the cremaster muscle. This effect was blocked with pretreatment of l-NA to inhibit NO. Another keratin fraction, alpha-keratose, which is the primary viscosic compound, was not found to induce vasodilation.
   Conclusions: The apparent mechanism of vasodilation was found to be NO-mediated and isolated to a particular purified fraction, the KAP.

SO ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS
AB Hydrogels are soft materials composed of a three-dimensional network which contain a high percentage of water similar to body tissue and are therefore regarded as a biocompatible material. Hydrogels have various potential applications in the biomedical field such as drug delivery and as scaffold for tissue engineering. Control over the physical properties of a hydrogel by an external stimulus is highly desirable and is therefore actively studied. Light is a particularly interesting stimulus to manipulate the properties of a hydrogel as it is a remote stimulus that can be controlled spatially and temporally with great ease and convenience. Therefore in recent years photoresponsive hydrogels have been investigated as an emerging biomaterial. Here we will review recent developments and discuss these new materials, and their applications in the biomedical field. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Forests are a natural resource of major economic significance to Canada, contributing $13.5 billion (2006) to the Canadian economy. However, the forest products industry is essentially an export industry and must compete locally and globally. The development of new and emerging products including biofuel and biomaterial derived from woody biomass will further drive up wood costs. As such, new products and process innovation are required to reduce production costs and gain market share. In this editorial, we summarize the role of sensors and how the use of sensors could provide means for cost reduction and new product development.

Firstly, the tabular and tubular[polytetrafluoroethylene(PTFE) capillary as supporter] PVA membranes were prepared; then, methoxy polyethylene glycol(mPEG) was grafted onto the surface of the PVA membranes. The effects of the shape, structure and properties of the membrane surface on blood compatibility were studied in detail. The experiment results show that mPEG modified PVA membranes, especially mPEG modified tubular membrane, could availably repel the adhesion of the platelets. In addition, the anticoagulant mechanism of mPEG with a steric repulsion effectiveness was confirmed further via different grafting methods.

TI Antibacterial effect of 317L stainless steel contained copper in
   prevention of implant-related infection in vitro and in vivo
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
AB Bone and intramedullary bacterial infections are one of the most serious complications of the surgical repair of fractures. To reduce the incidence of implant-related infections, several biomaterial surface treatments with integrated antibiotics, antiseptics, or metal ions have been developed for implants. In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity and biocompatibility of 317L stainless steel containing 4.5% copper alloy (317L-Cu) in vitro and in vivo using an animal model. Common pathogens of implant-related infections are Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, which were injected into implant materials to study their antimicrobial potential. We compared antimicrobial potential of 317L-Cu with 317L stainless steel (317L) and titanium (Ti-6Al-4V) alloys as controls. Compared with controls, 317L-Cu materials inhibited colonization by both bacteria in vitro and in vivo. Compared with 317L and Ti-6Al-4V controls, 317L-Cu showed no significant difference in colony formation of osteoblast-like cells on metal surfaces after 72 h of incubation in vitro. Metal screws containing these materials were also made for our vivo study in a rabbit model. Tissue-implants were analyzed for infection and inflammatory changes by hematoxylin-eosin staining of implants in bone. The screw tract inflammation and infection of 317L-Cu was minimal, although some inflammatory cells gathered at acutely infected sites. In addition, after materials had been implanted for 14 days in vivo, the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in osteoblasts around 317L-Cu screws tracts had increased compared with 317L and Ti-6Al-4V controls. Overall, 317L-Cu demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo and may be used as a biomaterial to reduce implant-related infections.

TI Enhancing water repellence and mechanical properties of antibacterial
   gelatin/Ce(III) fiber by heat treatment
SO JOURNAL OF RARE EARTHS
AB The water repellence and mechanical properties of the gelatin/Ce(III) fiber (GCe fiber) were improved by heat treatment, which was an easy and non-toxic method. The microscopic morphology, mechanical properties, antibacterial activity, and cell culture of the GCe fibers by heat treatment (HGCe fiber) were investigated. It was found that the water repellence and mechanical properties of the HGCe fibers increased significantly along with temperature increase. SEM observation showed that HGCe fibers had a fairly smooth surface and a compact structure. Detailed characterization revealed that the HGCe fibers exhibited similar antibacterial activity with the GCe fibers against Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, the results of cell culture by morphological assessment and methylthiazolyl tetrazolium assay (MTT assay) indicated the good biocompatibility of GCe fibers. Therefore, the HGCe fibers could be a promising candidate biomaterial for biomedicine applications.

TI Signal amelioration of electrophoretically deposited whole-cell

   Technologies (EMNT)
CY SEP 21-24, 2010

AB This paper presents an integrated whole-cell biochip system where functioning cells are deposited on the solid micro-machined surfaces while specially designed indium tin oxide electrodes that can be used to apply controllable electric fields during various stages; for example during cell deposition. The electrodes can be used also for sensing currents associated with the sensing mechanisms of electrochemical whole-cell biosensors. In this work a new approach integrating live bacterial cells on a biochip using electrophoretic deposition is presented. The biomaterial deposition technique was characterized under various driving potentials and chamber configurations. An analytical model of the electrophoretic deposition kinetics was developed and presented here. The deposited biomass included genetically engineered bacterial cells that may respond to toxic material exposure by expressing proteins that react with specific analytes generating electrochemically active byproducts. In this study the effect of external electric fields on the whole-cell biochips has been successfully developed and tested. The research hypothesis was that by applying electric fields on bacterial whole-cells, their permeability to the penetration of external analytes can be increased. This effect was tested and the results are shown here. The effect of prolonged and short external electric fields on the bioelectrochemical signal generated by sessile bacterial whole-cells in response to the presence of toxins was studied. It was demonstrated that relatively short 10 ms external DC electric pulse improves the performance of bacterial biosensors by 15% relative to un-biased biosensors. The application of prolonged 1 h external alternating electric fields deteriorated the whole-cell performance in the presence of toxins. In this paper we present the electrode apparatus and methods, as well as the characterization results, e.g. signal vs. time and induction factor, of such chips and discussing the highlight and problems of this new concept.

TI Scenery of Staphylococcus implant infections in orthopedics
SO FUTURE MICROBIOLOGY
AB Infection is still the major complication of orthopedic implants and projections based on the actual trend indicate that total hip and knee arthroplasties and their consequent infection burden are destined to greatly increase. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are the leading etiologic agents of orthopedic implant infection. Here we report on epidemiology of implant-related Staphylococcus infections in orthopedics, also referring to our experience, and focus on the crucial role of bacterial adhesins and on their ability to direct the pathogenesis process. Bacteria initiate implant infection by adhering to biomaterials. In the early steps of infection, adhesins mediate the specific interaction between microbial cells and the extracellular matrix proteins filming biomaterial surface. Then adhesin-mediated anchorage allows bacteria to cling to the biomaterial surface and to produce a biofilm that favors their ability to resist antibiotics. With the aim to prevent implant-related infections, anti-infective and infection-resistant biomaterials are being developed. The research for novel therapeutic strategies is incited by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Vaccines against the adhesins or antisense molecules against virulence genes can open a future in combating implant infections.

TI Cell-Biomaterial Mechanical Interaction in the Framework of Tissue
   Engineering: Insights, Computational Modeling and Perspectives
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Tissue engineering is an emerging field of research which combines the use of cell-seeded biomaterials both in vitro and/or in vivo with the aim of promoting new tissue formation or regeneration. In this context, how cells colonize and interact with the biomaterial is critical in order to get a functional tissue engineering product. Cell-biomaterial interaction is referred to here as the phenomenon involved in adherent cells attachment to the biomaterial surface, and their related cell functions such as growth, differentiation, migration or apoptosis. This process is inherently complex in nature involving many physico-chemical events which take place at different scales ranging from molecular to cell body (organelle) levels. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the mechanical environment at the cell-biomaterial location may play an important role in the subsequent cell function, which remains to be elucidated. In this paper, the state-of-the-art research in the physics and mechanics of cell-biomaterial interaction is reviewed with an emphasis on focal adhesions. The paper is focused on the different models developed at different scales available to simulate certain features of cell-biomaterial interaction. A proper understanding of cell-biomaterial interaction, as well as the development of predictive models in this sense, may add some light in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine fields.

TI Osteoconductive Capacity of Hydroxyapatite Implanted Into the Skull of
   Diabetics
SO JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY
AB Diabetes mellitus can cause various diseases, including loss of bone mineral density as a characteristic manifestation of osteoporosis. In this condition, bone is more vulnerable to pathologic fractures that can be treated by implantation of biomaterial grafts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the osteogenic capacity of hydroxyapatite implanted into bone defects in the skull of nonobese diabetic mice. Fifteen nonobese diabetic mice were divided into 3 groups: control (nondiabetic), spontaneously diabetic, and spontaneously diabetic receiving insulin replacement applied subcutaneously into the dorsum. Defects were created experimentally in the skull with a surgical bur and filled with hydroxyapatite granules. The animals were killed 4 weeks after surgery, and samples were obtained for analysis. Quantitative methods were used for measurement of the new bone formation. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test (P < 0.05). Radiographic results showed good radiopacity of the hydroxyapatite; however, radiolucent spots were seen between the hydroxyapatite granules in the diabetic groups, indicating infiltration of connective tissue. Microscopic results showed projections of newly formed bone from the margin of bone defect toward the implant. The quantity of newly formed bone was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that observed in the diabetic groups. The recipient area of diabetic groups contained a larger amount of connective tissue as demonstrated by radiographic analyses. In conclusion, the osteogenesis guided by the properties of hydroxyapatite may even occur in bone suffering from the effects of diabetes, but the quantity of newly formed bone is lower, and the process is slower.

TI Bicalcium Phosphate Filling-Up After Calvarial Unicortical Harvesting in
   Maxillofacial Surgery
SO JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY
AB The calvarium is one of the most common donor sites for bone grafting in maxillofacial and craniofacial surgery. The quality of the bone and the few after-effects that arise in calvarium make it a very good choice for reconstruction, especially in preprosthetic surgery. Nevertheless, calvaria harvesting of the outer table can leave a depression on the scalp, which can be perceptible and palpable. This point is always difficult to assume for patients. This absence of outer-layer reconstruction of the skull could also lead to a modification of biomechanical characteristics and fragility of the skull. This is the reason why we decided to fill up the donor site with an osseoconductive biomaterial: bicalcium phosphate. To evaluate this reconstruction, we reviewed 20 patients who have undergone this procedure. All patients have been seen 6 months after surgery, 11 of them with computed tomographic scans of the donor site. An aesthetic evaluation of the result was made by the patient through a questionnaire. With computed tomographic scans, we made qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the donor site. For 2 patients of them, histologic examination was performed to evaluate newly formed bone.
   The results of this study suggest that filling in the donor site with bicalcium phosphate improves the tolerance of calvaria harvesting. Bone colonization of the osseoconductive biomaterials leads to the formation of a new outer table of the skull. Taking into account the quality of the calvarial bone and the restoration of the donor site, calvaria harvesting is, in our hands, one of the best choices in craniofacial and maxillofacial reconstruction.

AB In recent years carrier-mediated drug delivery has emerged as a powerful methodology for the treatment of various pathologies. The therapeutic index of traditional and novel drugs is enhanced via the increase of specificity due to targeting of drugs to a particular tissue, cell or intracellular compartment, the control over release kinetics, the protection of the active agent, or a combination of the above. Collagen is an important biomaterial in medical applications and ideal as protein-based drug delivery platform due to its special characteristics, such as biocompatibility, low toxicity, biodegradability, and weak antigenicity. While some many attempts have been made, further work is needed to produce fully biocompatible collagen hydrogels of desired size and able to release drugs on a specific target. In this article we propose a novel method to obtain spherical particles made of polymerized collagen surrounded by DMPC liposomes. The liposomes allow to control both the particles dimension and the gelling environment during the collagen polymerization. Furthermore, an optical based method to visualize and quantify each step of the proposed protocol is detailed and discussed.

TI Identification and synthesis of novel biomaterials based on spider
   structural silk fibers
SO APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING
AB The diversity in function and mechanical behavior of spider silks, and the ability to produce these silks recombinantly, have tremendous potential in creating a new class of biomimetic materials. Here we investigate the structural and mechanical properties of pyriform silks from the golden orb-weaver, Nephila clavipes. Nanoscale indentation measurements using atomic force microscopy on natural pyriform silk suggests that this biomaterial has high toughness that may be suitable for dissipating high amounts of mechanical energy. We also observed the occurrence of highly organized nanocrystals within the pyriform silk fibers that may contribute to the remarkable energy dissipation capability of these silks. It has been demonstrated that poly-(Gly-Ala) and poly-Ala stretches within the internal block repeat modules of dragline silk fibroins form nanocrystals, and these nanocrystalline structures may be responsible for the high extensibility of the dragline silks. In contrast, amino acid sequence analysis shows that PySp2 does not contain the same motifs. In the absence of poly-(Gly-Ala) and poly-Ala repeats, we hypothesized that PySp2 contains new protein motifs sufficient to polymerize into functional structures. To investigate the functional contributions of these novel motifs during pyriform fiber formation, we expressed different recombinant PySp2 fibroins with various segments spanning its block repeat units. We demonstrate that PySp2 recombinant proteins with the Pro-rich sub-block domain (PXP motifs, where X= sub-set of the amino acids A, L, or R) and/or the Ser + Gln + Ala-rich sub-block domain (QQSSVAQS motifs) are sufficient for artificial fiber formation. Moreover, we show that recombinant PySp2 proteins that contain a single block repeat unit can self-assemble into foam-like nanostructures. Collectively, our findings support the use of PySp2 recombinant proteins for a wide range of biomimetic materials with morphologies ranging from fibers to porous structures.

TI Modulation of cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation on
   materials designed for body implants
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVANCES
AB The interaction of cells and tissues with artificial materials designed for applications in biotechnologies and in medicine is governed by the physical and chemical properties of the material surface. There is optimal cell adhesion to moderately hydrophilic and positively charged substrates, due to the adsorption of cell adhesion-mediating molecules (e.g. vitronectin, fibronectin) in an advantageous geometrical conformation, which makes specific sites on these molecules (e.g. specific amino acid sequences) accessible to cell adhesion receptors (e.g. integrins). Highly hydrophilic surfaces prevent the adsorption of proteins, or these molecules are bound very weakly. On highly hydrophobic materials, however, proteins are adsorbed in rigid and denatured forms, hampering cell adhesion. The wettability of the material surface, particularly in synthetic polymers, can be effectively regulated by physical treatments, e.g. by irradiation with ions, plasma or UV light. The irradiation-activated material surface can be functionalized by various biomolecules and nanoparticles. and this further enhances its attractiveness for cells and its effectiveness in regulating cell functions. Another important factor for cell-material interaction is surface roughness and surface topography. Nanostructured substrates (i.e. substrates with irregularities smaller than 100 nm), are generally considered to be beneficial for cell adhesion and growth, while microstructured substrates behave more controversially (e.g. they can hamper cell spreading and proliferation but they enhance cell differentiation, particularly in osteogenic cells). A factor which has been relatively less investigated, but which is essential for cell-material interaction, is material deformability. Highly soft and deformable substrates cannot resist the tractional forces generated by cells during cell adhesion, and cells are not able to attach, spread and survive on such materials. Local variation in the physical and chemical properties of the material surface can be advantageously used for constructing patterned surfaces. Micropatterned surfaces enable regionally selective cell adhesion and directed growth, which can be utilized in tissue engineering, in constructing microarrays and in biosensorics. Nanopatterned surfaces are an effective tool for manipulating the type, number, spacing and distribution of ligands for cell adhesion receptors on the material surface. As a consequence, these surfaces are able to control the size, shape, distribution and maturity of focal adhesion plaques on cells, and thus cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation and other cell functions.

TI Impact of pressure and gas type on adhesion formation and biomaterial
   integration in laparoscopy
SO SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
AB Background Laparoscopic mesh repair of inguinal and incisional hernias has been widely adopted. Nevertheless, knowledge about the impact of pneumoperitoneum on mesh integration is rare. The present study investigates pressure and gas-dependent effects of pneumoperitoneum on adhesion formation and biomaterial integration in a standardized animal model.
   Methods Laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh implantation (IPOM) was performed in 32 female chinchilla rabbits using CO(2) or helium for pneumoperitoneum. Intra-abdominal pressures were 3 or 6 mmHg. Animals were killed after 21 days, and the abdominal wall was explanted for subsequent histopathological examinations. Adhesions were assessed qualitatively with a scoring system, and the adhesion surface was analyzed semiquantitatively by planimetry. Infiltration of macrophages (CD68), expression of matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13), and cell proliferation (Ki67) were analyzed at the mesh to host interface by immunohistochemistry. The collagen type I/III ratio was analyzed by cross-polarization microscopy to determine the quality of mesh integration.
   Results After 21 days, perifilamental infiltration with macrophages (CD68) and percentage of proliferating cells (Ki67) were highest after 6 mmHg of CO(2) pneumoperitoneum. The extent of adhesions, as well as the expression of MMP-13 and the collagen type I/III ratio, were similar between groups.
   Conclusions Our experiments showed no pressure or gas-dependent alterations of adhesion formation and only minor effects on biomaterial integration. Altogether, there is no evidence for a clinically negative effect of CO(2) pneumoperitoneum.

TI Culture and differentiation of osteoblasts on coral scaffold from human
   bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
SO CELL AND TISSUE BANKING
AB In this paper we describe an approach that aims to provide fundamental information towards a scientific, biomechanical basis for the use of natural coral scaffolds to initiate mesenchymal stem cells into osteogenic differentiation for transplant purposes. Biomaterial, such as corals, is an osteoconductive material that can be used to home human derived stem cells for clinical regenerative purposes. In bone transplantation, the use of biomaterials may be a solution to bypass two main critical obstacles, the shortage of donor sites for autografts and the risk of rejection with allograft procedures. Bone regeneration is often needed for multiple clinical purposes for instance, in aesthetic reconstruction and regenerative procedures. Coral graft Porites lutea has been used by our team for a decade in clinical applications on over a thousand patients with different bone pathologies including spinal stenosis and mandibular reconstruction. It is well accepted that human bone marrow (hBM) is an exceptional source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which may differentiate into different cell phenotypes such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, myocytes, cardiomyocytes and neurons. Isolated MSCs from human bone marrow were induced into osteoblasts using an osteogenic medium enriched with two specific growth factors, FGF9 and vitamin D2. Part of the cultured MSCs were directly transferred and seeded onto coral scaffolds (Porites Lutea) and induced to differentiate into osteoblasts and part were cultured in flasks for osteocell culture. The data support the concept that hBM is a reliable source of MSCs which may be easily differentiated into osteoblasts and seeded into coral as an optimal device for clinical application. Within this project we have also discussed the biological nature of MSCs, their potential application for clinical transplantation and the prospect of their use in gene therapy.

TI In Vitro Model of Bacterial Biofilm Formation on Polyvinyl Chloride
   Biomaterial
SO CELL BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS
AB The aim of the study was to establish an in vitro model of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms on polyvinyl chloride (PVC) material, and to investigate bacterial biofilm formation and its structure using the combined approach of confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria (stain RP62A) were incubated with PVC pieces in Tris buffered saline to form biofilms. Biofilm formation was examined at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 48 h. Thicknesses of these biofilms and the number, and percentage of viable cells in biofilms were measured. CT scan images of biofilms were obtained using CLSM and environmental SEM. The results of this study showed that Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm is a highly organized multi-cellular structure. The biofilm is constituted of large number of viable and dead bacterial cells. Bacterial biofilm formation on the surface of PVC material was found to be a dynamic process with maximal thickness being attained at 12-18 h. These biofilms became mature by 24 h. There was significant difference in the percentage of viable cells along with interior, middle, and outer layers of biofilms (P < 0.05). Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm is sophisticated in structure and the combination method involving CLSM and SEM was ideal for investigation of biofilms on PVC material.

TI Nitric Oxide-Generating Silicone As a Blood-Contacting Biomaterial
SO ASAIO JOURNAL
AB Coagulation upon blood-contacting biomaterials remains a problem for short-and long-term clinical applications. This study examined the ability of copper(II)-doped silicone surfaces to generate nitric oxide (NO) and locally inhibit coagulation. Silicone was doped with 3-mu m copper [Cu(0)] particles yielding 3 to 10 weight percent (wt%) Cu in 70-mu m thick Cu/silicone polymeric matrix composites (Cu/Si PMCs). At 3, 5, 8, and 10 wt% Cu doping, the surface expression of Cu was 12.1% +/- 2.8%, 19.7% +/- 5.4%, 29.0% +/- 3.8%, and 33.8% +/- 6.5%, respectively. After oxidizing Cu(0) to Cu(II) by spontaneous corrosion, NO flux, J(NO) (mol . cm(-2) . min(-1)), as measured by chemiluminescence, increased with surface Cu expression according to the relationship J(NO) = (1.63% SA(Cu) - 0.81) x 10(-11), R(2) = 0.98, where %SA(Cu) is the percentage of surface occupied by Cu. NO flux at 10 wt% Cu was 5.35 +/- 0.74 x 10(-10) mol . cm(-2) . min(-1). The clotting time of sheep blood exposed to these surfaces was 80 +/- 13 seconds with pure silicone and 339 +/- 44 seconds when 10 wt% Cu(II) was added. Scanning electron microscopies (SEMs) of coatings showed clots occurred away from exposed Cu dendrites. In conclusion, Cu/Si PMCs inhibit coagulation in a dose-dependent fashion related to the extent of copper exposure on the coated surface. ASAIO Journal 2011; 57:539-544.

TI State diagram of salmon (Salmo salar) gelatin films
SO JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
CT 11th International Symposium on the Properties of Water (ISOPOW)
CY SEP, 2010
CL Queretaro, MEXICO
AB BACKGROUND: A state diagram presents different physical states of a biomaterial as a function of solid content and temperature. Despite their technological interest, little information is available on protein systems such as gelatin/water mixtures. The objective of this work was to develop state diagrams of salmon gelatin (SG) and bovine gelatin (BG) in order to determine maximal freeze concentration parameters (T-g', T-m' and X-s') and to relate possible differences to their biochemical characteristics.
   RESULTS: Biochemical characterisation of SG showed lower molecular weight and iminoacid concentration compared with BG. Likewise, the glass transition temperature (T-g) was lower for SG at X-s > 0.8, which was associated with its lower molecular weight. Unexpectedly, the depression of freezing temperature (T-f) was greater for SG at X-s > 0.1, which was associated with its higher ash content. Isothermal annealing produced effective values of T-g' approximate to -52 degrees C, T-m' approximate to -46 degrees C and X-s' approximate to 0.6 for both gelatins. Interestingly, the enthalpy change associated with T-m' (Delta HTm) was significantly higher for SG than for BG after annealing, indicating a higher proportion of ice present at about -50 degrees C.
   CONCLUSION: Maximal freeze concentration parameters were similar between the two gelatins, though differences in biochemical properties were evident. The results show that there are likely different ways of interaction of SG and BG with water. (C) 2011 Society of Chemical Industry

TI Nanowired three-dimensional cardiac patches
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Engineered cardiac patches for treating damaged heart tissues after a heart attack are normally produced by seeding heart cells within three-dimensional porous biomaterial scaffolds(1-3). These biomaterials, which are usually made of either biological polymers such as alginate(4) or synthetic polymers such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA)(5), help cells organize into functioning tissues, but poor conductivity of these materials limits the ability of the patch to contract strongly as a unit(6). Here, we show that incorporating gold nanowires within alginate scaffolds can bridge the electrically resistant pore walls of alginate and improve electrical communication between adjacent cardiac cells. Tissues grown on these composite matrices were thicker and better aligned than those grown on pristine alginate and when electrically stimulated, the cells in these tissues contracted synchronously. Furthermore, higher levels of the proteins involved in muscle contraction and electrical coupling are detected in the composite matrices. It is expected that the integration of conducting nanowires within three-dimensional scaffolds may improve the therapeutic value of current cardiac patches.

TI Comparison between nuclear magnetic resonance profiling and the
   source/sink approach for characterizing drug diffusion in hydrogel
   matrices
SO PHARMACEUTICAL DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In controlled drug delivery, the drug diffusion coefficient in a given matrix is a key factor for predicting its release rate. In this work, we compare P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) profiling for obtaining the mutual-diffusion coefficient (D-m(gel)) of a drug in hydrogel with results obtained from conventional source/sink experiments. Despite the fact that NMR profiling is a powerful approach for measuring transport properties, it is rarely used for characterizing drug diffusion in gel matrices in pharmaceutical sciences. This work provides an illustration of the applicability of this technique and highlights its advantages for studying drug release systems. The comparison with results obtained from the source/sink experiment clearly establishes the validity of the NMR profiling approach. Alendronate was used as a model drug while curdlan, a gel-forming bacterial polysaccharide, served as a model biomaterial. The determined D-m(gel) value (5.6 +/- 0.3 x 10(-10) m(2)/s) agrees with the one obtained from a conventional source/sink experiment (5.4 +/- 0.5 x 10(-10) m(2)/s). In addition, the alendronate self-diffusion coefficients in solution (D-s(sln)) and in the hydrogel (D-s(gel)) were measured on the same system using pulse-field gradient (PFG) P-31 NMR. These supplementary parameters provided a more detailed characterization of the drug transport properties in the gel matrix.

TI Continuous Gradients of Material Composition and Growth Factors for
   Effective Regeneration of the Osteochondral Interface
SO TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A
AB Most contemporary biomaterial designs for osteochondral regeneration utilize monolithic, biphasic, or even multiphasic constructs. We have introduced a microsphere-based approach to create a continuous gradient in both material composition and encapsulated growth factors. The gradients were fabricated by filling a cylindrical mold with opposing gradients of two different types of poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres. The chondrogenic microspheres were loaded with transforming growth factor-beta 1, whereas the osteogenic microspheres contained bone morphogenetic protein-2 with or without nanophase hydroxyapatite. The gradient scaffolds (material gradient only, signal gradient only, or material/signal gradient combination) or blank control scaffolds were implanted in 3.5 mm-diameter defects in rabbit knees for 6 or 12 weeks. This is the first in vivo evaluation of these novel gradient scaffolds in the knee. The gross morphology, MRI, and histology indicated that the greatest extent of regeneration was achieved when both signal and material gradients were included together. This combination resulted in complete bone ingrowth, with an overlying cartilage layer with high glycosaminoglycan content, appropriate thickness, and integration with the surrounding cartilage and underlying bone. The results suggest that osteochondral regeneration may benefit from biomaterials that integrate a continuous gradient in both material composition and encapsulated growth factors.

TI Electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds for controlled release of
   adeno-associated viral vectors
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB The integration of viral gene delivery with key features of biomaterial scaffolds that modulate viral delivery in a controlled manner offers a promising strategy for numerous tissue engineering applications. In this study adeno-associated virus (AAV), which is widely utilized in human gene therapy as a gene carrier due to its safety and efficient gene delivery capability, was encapsulated within electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds composed of blended mixtures of elastin-like polypeptides (ELP) and poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and was employed to transduce fibroblasts adherent on the scaffolds. Combinatorial interactions between ELP and PCL chains upon physical blending significantly altered the mechanical properties (i.e. wettability, elastic modulus, strain, etc.) of the ELP/PCL composites, thus providing key tools to mediate controlled release of AAV vectors and robust cellular transduction on the fibrous scaffolds. The ability of ELP/PCL composites to manipulate the controlled release of AAV-mediated gene delivery for subsequent high-efficiency cellular transduction will provide tremendous opportunities for a variety of tissue engineering applications.

TI Biomaterial implants mediate autologous stem cell recruitment in mice
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB Autologous stem cells, recognized as the best cells for stem cell therapy, are associated with difficult extraction procedures which often lead to more traumas for the patients and time-consuming laboratory work, which delays their subsequent application. To combat such challenges, it was recently uncovered that, shortly after biomaterial implantation, following the recruitment of inflammatory cells, substantial numbers of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were recruited to the implantation sites. These multipotent MSC could be differentiated into various lineages in vitro. Inflammatory signals may be responsible for the gathering of stem cells, since there is a good relationship between biomaterial-mediated inflammatory responses and stem cell accumulation in vivo. In addition, the treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone substantially reduced the recruitment of both MSC and HSC. The results from this work support that such strategies could be further developed towards localized recruitment and differentiation of progenitor cells. This may permit the future development of autologous stem cell therapies without the need for tedious cell isolation, culture and transplantation. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Temporal differences in Erk1/2 activity distinguish among combinations
   of extracellular matrix components
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB Rational design of biomaterials requires understanding how cells interrogate their microenvironment. In this study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells are cultured on combinations of extracellular matrix (ECM) components (collagen I, collagen IV, vitronectin, fibronectin, laminin, heparan sulfate proteoglycan, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan), and the phosphorylation of four intracellular signaling kinases (Erk1/2, JNK, Akt1, and NF kappa B) is quantified. These combinations of ECM components elicit different temporal patterns of Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Collagen I-containing substrates cause Erk1/2 phosphorylation to reach maximal levels at 30 min and remain near maximal levels until 90 min. Collagen IV/laminin substrates elicit maximal phosphorylation at 30-45 min, and then phosphorylation decreases substantially at 60-90 min. All other combinations studied (collagen IV and vitronectin-based combinations) cause an increase in phosphorylation at 30-45 min, but not to maximal levels: maximal phosphorylation is reached by 60-90 min. These temporal patterns of phosphorylation may explain how a limited number of intracellular signaling pathways can distinguish among thousands of possible combinations of microenvironmental cues by adding to the information contained in each cell signaling pathway.

TI Transport of biological molecules in surfactant-alginate composite
   hydrogels
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB Obstructed transport of biological molecules can result in improper release of pharmaceuticals or biologics from biomedical devices. Recent studies have shown that nonionic surfactants, such as Pluronic F68 (F68), positively alter biomaterial properties such as mesh size and microcapsule diameter. To further understand the effect of F68 (incorporated at concentrations well above the critical micelle concentration (CMC)) in traditional biomaterials, the transport properties of BSA and riboflavin were investigated in F68-alginate composite hydrogels, formed by both internal and external cross-linking with divalent cations. Results indicate that small molecule transport (represented by riboflavin) was not significantly hindered by F68 in homogeneously (internally) cross-linked hydrogels (up to an 11% decrease in loading capacity and 14% increase in effective diffusion coefficient. Den), while protein transport in homogeneously cross-linked hydrogels (represented by BSA) was significantly affected (up to a 43% decrease in loading capacity and 40% increase in D(eff)). For inhomogeneously cross-linked hydrogels (externally cross-linked by CaCl(2) or BaCl(2)), the D(eff) increased up to 50 and 83% for small molecules and proteins, respectively. Variation in the alginate gelation method was shown to affect transport through measurable changes in swelling ratio (30% decrease) and observable changes in cross-linking structure as well as up to a 3.6- and 11.8-fold difference in D(eff) for riboflavin and BSA, respectively. Aside from the expected significant changes due to the cross-linking method utilized, protein transport properties were altered due to mesh size restrictions (10-25 nm estimated by mechanical properties) and BSA-F68 interaction (DLS). Taken as a whole, these results show that incorporation of a nonionic surfactant at concentrations above the CMC can affect device functionality by impeding the transport of large biological molecules.

TI Effect of subvoxel processes on non-destructive characterization of
   beta-tricalcium phosphate bone graft substitutes
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB The geometric features of bone graft substitutes, such as the pore and pore interconnection sizes, are of paramount importance for their biological performance. Such features are generally characterized by micro-computed tomography (mu CT). Unfortunately, the resolution of mu CT is often too limited. The aim of this study was to look at the effect of mu CT resolution on the geometric characterization of four different bone graft substitutes. An attempt was also made to improve the characterization of these materials by applying a subvoxelization algorithm. The results revealed that both approaches increased the accuracy of the geometric characterization. They also showed that the interconnection size in particular was affected. Comparing the results obtained from the scanned and numerical subvoxelization datasets revealed a minor difference of less than 2.5% for the porosity values. The difference for the pore sizes was up to 10%. Considerable differences of up to 35-50% were found for the interconnection sizes. The present study demonstrates how complex geometric characterization is and how important it is for biomaterial researchers to be aware of the impact of mu CT resolution on the pore and pore interconnection sizes.

AB Background: Injectable bulking agents have been used with varying success for the treatment of faecal incontinence. This systematic review aimed to investigate the various injectable agents and techniques used for the treatment of faecal incontinence, and to assess their safety and efficacy.
   Methods: Thirty-nine publications were identified and studied. The following variables were pooled for univariable analysis: type, location, route of bulking agents, and the use of ultrasound guidance, antibiotics, laxatives and anaesthetics. Predictors of the development of complications and successful outcomes were identified by multivariable logistic regression analysis.
   Results: A total of 1070 patients were included in the analysis. On multivariable analysis, the only significant predictor of the development of complications was the route of injection of bulking agents (odds ratio 3.40, 95 per cent confidence interval 1.62 to 7.12; P = 0.001). Two variables were significant predictors of a successful short-term outcome: the use of either PTQ (R) (OR 5.93, 2.21 to 16.12; P = 0.001) or Coaptite (R) (OR 10.74, 1.73 to 65.31; P = 0.001) was associated with a greater likelihood of success. Conversely, the use of local anaesthetic was associated with a lower likelihood of success (OR 0.18, 0.05 to 0.59; P = 0.005). Failure to use laxatives in the postoperative period resulted in a poorer medium-to longer-term outcome (OR 0.13, 0.06 to 0.25; P = 0.001).
   Conclusion: This systematic review has identified variations in the practice of injection of bulking agents that appear to influence the likelihood of complications and affect the outcomes after treatment.

TI Novel bulking agent for faecal incontinence
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB Background: Various injectable bulking agents have been used for the treatment of faecal incontinence (FI). However, encouraging early results are not maintained over time. This study aimed to assess short- and medium-term results of a new bulking agent for the treatment of FI.
   Methods: The Gatekeeper (TM) prosthesis comprises a thin solid polyacrylonitrile cylinder that becomes thicker, shorter and softer within 24 h after implantation. Fourteen patients with FI underwent treatment with Gatekeeper (TM) under local anaesthesia. Four prostheses were implanted in the intersphincteric space in each patient, under endoanal ultrasound guidance. Number of episodes of major FI, Cleveland Clinic FI score (CCFIS), Vaizey score, anorectal manometry, endoanal ultrasonography (EUS), health status and quality of life (Short Form 36 and Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life questionnaires) were assessed before and after treatment.
   Results: Mean(s.d.) follow-up was 33.5(12.4) months. There were no complications. There was a significant decrease in major FI episodes from 7.1(7.4) per week at baseline to 1.4(4.0), 1.0(3.2) and 0.4(0.6) per week respectively at 1-month, 3-month and last follow-up (P = 0.002). CCFIS improved significantly from 12.7(3.3) to 4.1(3.0), 3.9(2.6) and 5.1(3.0) respectively (P < 0.001), and Vaizey score from 15.4(3.3) to 7.1(3.9), 4.7(3.0) and 6.9(5.0) respectively (P = 0.010). Soiling and ability to postpone defaecation improved significantly, and patients reported significant improvement in health status and quality of life. At follow-up, manometric parameters had not changed and EUS did not demonstrate any prosthesis dislocation.
   Conclusion: The Gatekeeper (TM) anal implant seemed safe, reliable and effective. Initial clinical improvement was maintained over time, and follow-up data were encouraging.

TI Comparison of in vitro biocompatibility of NanoBone (R) and BioOss (R)
   for human osteoblasts
SO CLINICAL ORAL IMPLANTS RESEARCH
AB Introduction: Scaffolds for bone tissue engineering seeded with the patient's own cells might be used as a preferable method to repair bone defects in the future. With the emerging new technologies of nanostructure design, new synthetic biomaterials are appearing on the market. Such scaffolds must be tested in vitro for their biocompatibility before clinical application. However, the choice between a natural or a synthetic biomaterial might be challenging for the doctor and the patient. In this study, we compared the biocompatibility of a synthetic bone substitute, NanoBone (R), to the widely used natural bovine bone replacement material BioOss (R).
   Material and methods: The in vitro behaviour of human osteoblasts on both materials was investigated. Cell performance was determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cell vitality staining and four biocompatibility tests (LDH, MTT, WST, BrdU).
   Results: We found that both materials showed low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility. The MTT proliferation test was superior for Nanobone (R).
   Discussion: Both scaffolds caused only little damage to human osteoblasts and justify their clinical application. However, NanoBone (R) was able to support and promote proliferation of human osteoblasts slightly better than BioOss (R) in our chosen test set-up. The results may guide doctors and patients when being challenged with the choice between a natural or a synthetic biomaterial. Further experiments are necessary to determine the comparison of biocompatibility in vivo.

TI Effect of beta-sheet crystalline content on mass transfer in silk films
SO JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE
AB The material properties of silk are favorable for drug delivery due to the ability to control material structure and morphology under ambient, aqueous processing conditions. Mass transport of compounds with varying physical-chemical characteristics was studied in silk fibroin films with control of beta-sheet crystalline content. Two compounds, vitamin B12 and fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC) labeled lysozyme were studied in a diffusion apparatus to determine transport through silk films. The films exhibited size exclusion phenomenon with permeability coefficients with contrasting trends with increases in beta-sheet crystallinity. The size exclusion phenomenon observed with the two model compounds was characterized by contrasting trends in permeability coefficients of the films as a function of beta-sheet crystallinity. The diffusivity of the compounds was examined in the context of free volume theory. Apart from the beta-sheet crystallinity, size of the compound and its interactions with silk influenced mass transfer. Diffusivity of vitamin B12 was modeled to define a power law relationship with beta-sheet crystallinity. The results of the study demonstrate that diffusion of therapeutic agents though silk fibroin films can be directed to match a desired rate by modulating secondary structure of the silk proteins.

TI The pivotal role of fibrocytes and mast cells in mediating fibrotic
   reactions to biomaterials
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Almost all biomaterial implants are surrounded by a fibrotic capsule, although the mechanism of biomaterial-mediated fibrotic reactions is mostly unclear. To search for the types of cells responsible for triggering the tissue responses, we used poly-L glycolic acid polymers capable of releasing various reagents. We first identified that CD45(+)/Collagen 1(+) fibrocytes are recruited and resided within the fibrotic capsule at the implant interface. Interestingly, we found that the recruitment of fibrocytes and the extent of fibrotic tissue formation (collagen type I production) were substantially enhanced and reduced by the localized release of compound 48/80 and cromolyn, respectively. Since it is well established that compound 48/80 and cromolyn alter mast cell reactions, we hypothesized that mast cells are responsible for triggering fibrocyte recruitment and subsequent fibrotic capsule formation surrounding biomaterial implants. To directly test this hypothesis, similar studies were carried out using mast cell deficient mice, WBB6F1/J-Kir(W)/Kit(W-v)/, and their congenic controls. Indeed, mast cell deficient mice prompted substantially less fibrocyte and myofibroblast responses in comparison to C57 wild type mice controls. Most interestingly, subcutaneous mast cell reconstitution of WBB6F1/J-Kit(W)/Kit(W-v)/J mice almost completely restored the fibrocyte response in comparison to the C57 wild type response. These results indicate that the initial biomaterial interaction resulting in the stimulation of mast cells and degranulation byproducts not only stimulates the inflammatory cascade but significantly alters the downstream fibrocyte response and degree of fibrosis.

TI Changes of chondrocyte expression profiles in human MSC aggregates in
   the presence of PEG microspheres and TGF-beta 3
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Biomaterial microparticles are commonly utilized as growth factor delivery vehicles to induce chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). To address whether the presence of microparticles could themselves affect differentiation of MSCs, a 3D co-aggregate system was developed containing an equal volume of human primary bone marrow-derived MSCs and non-degradable RGD-conjugated poly(ethylene glycol) microspheres (PEG-mu s). Following TGF-beta 3 induction, differences in cell phenotype, gene expression and protein localization patterns were found when compared to MSC aggregate cultures devoid of PEG-mu s. An outer fibrous layer always found in differentiated MSC aggregate cultures was not formed in the presence of PEG-mu s. Type II collagen protein was synthesized by cells in both culture systems, although increased levels of the long (embryonic) procollagen isoforms were found in MSC/PEG-mu s aggregates. Ubiquitous deposition of type I and type X collagen proteins was found in MSC/PEG-mu s cultures while the expression patterns of these collagens was restricted to specific areas in MSC aggregates. These findings show that MSCs respond differently to TGF-beta 3 when in a PEG-mu s environment due to effects of cell dilution, altered growth factor diffusion and/or cellular interactions with the microspheres. Although not all of the expression patterns pointed toward improved chondrogenic differentiation in the MSC/PEG-mu s cultures, the surprisingly large impact of the microparticles themselves should be considered when designing drug delivery/scaffold strategies.

TI Molecular and functional characterisation of resilin across three insect
   orders
SO INSECT BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Resilin is an important elastomeric protein of insects, with roles in the storage and release of energy during a variety of different functional categories including flight and jumping. To date, resilin genes and protein function have been characterised only in a small number of flying insects, despite their importance in fleas and other jumping insects. Microscopy and immunostaining studies of resilin in flea demonstrate the presence of resilin pads in the pleural arch at the top of the hind legs, a region responsible for the flea's jumping ability. A degenerate primer approach was used to amplify resilin gene transcripts from total RNA isolated from flea (Ctenocephalides fells). buffalo fly (Haematobia irritans exigua) and dragonfly (Aeshna sp.) pharate adults, and full-length transcripts were successfully isolated. Two isoforms (A and B) were amplified from each of flea and buffalo fly, and isoform B only in dragonfly. Flea and buffalo fly isoform B transcripts were expressed in an Escherichia coli expression system, yielding soluble recombinant proteins Cf-resB and Hi-resB respectively. Protein structure and mechanical properties of each protein before and after crosslinking were assessed. This study shows that resilin gene and protein sequences are broadly conserved and that crosslinked recombinant resilin proteins share similar mechanical properties from flying to jumping insects. A combined use of degenerate primers and polyclonal sera will likely facilitate characterisation of resilin genes from other insect and invertebrate orders.

TI Optimizing the Osteogenic Potential of Adult Stem Cells for Skeletal
   Regeneration
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH
AB Adult stem cells, including mesenchymal stem cells, display plasticity in that they can differentiate toward various lineages including bone cells, cartilage cells, fat cells, and other types of connective tissue cells. However, it is not clear what factors direct adult stem cell lineage commitment and terminal differentiation. Emerging evidence suggests that extracellular physical cues have the potential to control stem cell lineage specification. In this perspective article, we review recent findings on biomaterial surface and mechanical signal regulation of stem cell differentiation. Specifically, we focus on stem cell response to substrate nanoscale topography and fluid flow induced shear stress and how these physical factors may regulate stem cell osteoblastic differentiation in vitro.

TI Vitamin E Blended Uhmwpe May Have the Potential to Reduce Bacterial
   Adhesive Ability
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH
AB Biomaterial-associated infection (BAI), a clinical problem resulting in septic failure of joint replacement implants, is initiated by bacterial adhesion, often by Staphylococcus epidermidis. Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is a material of choice for joint replacement; reducing the adhesion of S. epidermidis to the polymer could be a means to decrease infection. We examined the adhesion of two ATCC and one clinical strain of S. epidermidis to standard polyethylene (PE), vitamin E blended UHMWPE (VE-PE), and oxidized UHMWPE (OX-PE) after different incubation times: a significant (p < 0.01) decrease in the adhered staphylococci on VE-PE and a significantly higher incidence of the dislodged biofilm bacteria on OX-PE was observed compared with that registered on PE. With attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-FTIR spectroscopy before and after suspension in bacterial medium for 48 h, new absorptions were observed mainly in OX-PE, indicating adsorption of protein-like substances on the polymer surface. We hypothesized that the different hydrophilicity of the surfaces with different chemical characteristics influenced protein adsorption and bacterial adhesion. These results may have clinical implications concerning the prevention of septic loosening: the VE-PE could have the potential to reduce S. epidermidis adhesive ability if the preliminary data observed in these selected strains is further confirmed, as diversity among clinical strains is well known.

TI Repair of Rat Cranial Bone Defects with nHAC/PLLA and BMP-2-Related
   Peptide or rhBMP-2
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH
AB An ideal artificial substitute has good biocompatibility properties and is able to provide for rapid bone formation. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is considered as one of the most important growth factors for bone regeneration. In this study, a synthetic BMP-2-related peptide (designated P24) corresponding to residues of the knuckle epitope of BMP-2 was introduced into a bioactive scaffold based on nano-hydroxyapatite/collagen/poly(L-lactic acid) (nHAC/PLLA); its in vitro release kinetics was then measured. A 5 mm diameter cranial bone defect was created in the calvariae of 30 rats and randomly implanted with three groups of biomaterials: Group A (nHAC/PLLA alone); Group B (P24/nHAC/PLLA composite); and Group C (recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2)/nHAC/PLLA composite). The P24/nHAC/PLLA implants significantly stimulated bone growth similarly to the rhBMP-2/nHAC/PLLA implants based on the radiographic and three-dimensional CT evaluation and histological examination, thereby confirming the enhanced bone healing rate of these compounds compared with the stand-alone nHAC/PLLA scaffold material. The osteoinductive ability of 3 mg P24 was similar to that of 1 mu g rhBMP-2. P24/nHAC/PLLA is a promising scaffold biomaterial for bone tissue regeneration. (C) 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society.

TI rhBMP-2 not alendronate combined with HA-TCP biomaterial and distraction
   osteogenesis enhance bone formation
SO ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY
AB The long treatment duration of distraction osteogenesis (DO) usually causes some complications such as re-fracture, non-union. We have previously demonstrated that the combined use of biomaterial with distraction osteogenesis technique can enhance bone formation and consolidation. This study further tested whether the use of biological agents such as rhBMP-2 or alendronate together with biomaterials in DO will further promote bone formation.
   A 1.0-cm tibial shaft was removed in the left tibia of 30 rabbits. The 1.0-cm defect gap was reduced to 0.5 cm and the remaining 0.5-cm defect gap was filled with 0.5-cm restorable hydroxyapatite/tri-calcium phosphates (HA/TCP) cylindrical block. The animals were divided into three groups with the following added on the HA/TCP block: Group A 50 mu l of saline, Group B 75 mu g rhBMP-2 in 50 mu l of saline, Group C 250 mu g alendronate in 50 mu l saline. The tibia was then fixed with unilateral lengthener and lengthening started 7 days after at a rate of 1.0 mm/day for 5 days. All animals were terminated at day 37 following surgery. The excised bone specimens were subject to micro-CT, mechanical testing and histological examinations.
   Bone mineral density and content were significantly higher in Groups A and B compared to Group C and the mechanical properties of the regenerates in Group B were highest. Micro-CT and histological examinations also confirmed that the regenerates in Group B had the most advanced bone formation, consolidation and remodeling comparing to other groups.
   The combined use of rhBMP-2 with HA-TCP biomaterial in DO has significantly enhanced bone formation and consolidation than using the HA-TCP biomaterials alone, whereas the use of alendronate has inhibitory effects on bone formation.

TI The role of stem cells in fracture healing and nonunion
SO INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS
AB Nonunion and large bone defects present a therapeutic challenge to the surgeon and are often associated with significant morbidity. These defects are expensive to both the health care system and society. However, several surgical procedures have been developed to maximise patient satisfaction and minimise health-care-associated and socioeconomic costs. Integrating recent evidence into the diamond concept leads to one simple conclusion that not only provides us with answers to the "open questions" but also simplifies our entire understanding of bone healing. It has been shown that a combination of neo-osteogenesis and neovascularisation will restore tissue deficits, and that the optimal approach includes a biomaterial scaffold, cell biology techniques, a growth factor and optimisation of the mechanical environment. Further prospective, controlled, randomised clinical studies will determine the effectiveness and economic benefits of treatment with mesenchymal stem cells, not in comparison to other conventional surgical approaches but in direct conjunction with them.

TI Minimally invasive, longitudinal monitoring of biomaterial-associated
   inflammation by fluorescence imaging
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Implant-associated inflammation is a major cause for the reduced performance/lifetime and failure of numerous medical devices. Therefore, the ability to non-invasively and quantitatively monitor implant-associated inflammation is critically important. Here we show that implant-associated inflammation can be imaged via fluorescence imaging using near-infrared hydrocyanine dyes delivered either locally or intravenously in living mice. This imaging strategy allowed quantitative longitudinal monitoring of inflammation by detecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) released by inflammatory cells in response to implanted poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) disks or injected poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles, and exhibited a strong correlation to conventional analysis of inflammation. Furthermore, modulation of inflammatory responses via controlled release of the anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone was detected using this sensitive imaging approach. Thus, hydrocyanine-based fluorescence imaging of ROS could serve as a surrogate measure for monitoring implant-associated inflammation as well as evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic approaches to modulate host responses to implanted medical devices.

TI Engineering vessel-like networks within multicellular fibrin-based
   constructs
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Sufficient vascularization in engineered tissues can be achieved through coordinated application of improved biomaterial systems with proper cell types. In this study, we employed 3D fibrin gels alone or in combination with the synthetic poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA)/polylactic-glycolic acid (PLGA) sponges to support in-vitro construct vascularization and to enhance neovascularization upon implantation. Two multicellular assays were embedded in these constructs: (a) co-culture of endothelial (EC) and fibroblast cells, and (b) a tri-culture combination of ECs, fibroblasts and tissue specific skeletal myoblast cells. In-vitro vessel network formation was examined under advanced confocal microscopy in various time points from cell seeding. Vessel network maturity levels and morphology were found to be highly regulated by fibrinogen concentrations in-vitro. Combination of PLLA/PLGA sponges with fibrin matrices provided added mechanical strength and featured highly mature vessels-like networks. Implantation studies revealed that the implanted ECs developed into 3D interconnected vessel-like networks in-vivo. The PLLA/PLGA scaffold proved to be a key stimulator of neovascularization and perfusion of implanted grafts. Our findings demonstrate that complex biomaterial platform involving fibrin and PLLA/PLGA synthetic scaffold provide a way to enhancing vascularization in-vitro and in-vivo. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI The role of protein solubilization in antigen removal from xenogeneic
   tissue for heart valve tissue engineering
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Decellularization techniques have been developed in an attempt to reduce the antigenicity of xenogeneic biomaterials, a critical barrier in their use as tissue engineering scaffolds. However, numerous studies have demonstrated inadequate removal and subsequent persistence of antigens in the biomaterial following decellularization, resulting in an immune response upon implantation. Thus, methods to enhance antigen removal (AR) are critical for the use of xenogeneic biomaterials in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In the present study, AR methods incorporating protein solubilization principles were investigated for their ability to reduce antigenicity of bovine pericardium (BP) for heart valve tissue engineering. Bovine pericardium following AR (BP-AR) was assessed for residual antigenicity, tensile properties, and extracellular matrix composition. Increasing protein solubility during AR significantly decreased the residual antigenicity of BP-AR by an additional 80% compared to hypotonic solution or 60% compared to 0.1% (w/v) SDS decellularization methods. Moreover, solubilizing agents have a dominant effect on reducing the level of residual antigenicity of BP-AR beyond that achieved by AR additives alone. Tested AR methods did not compromise the tensile properties of BP-AR compared to native BP. Furthermore, residual cell nuclei did not correlate to residual antigenicity, demonstrating that residual nuclei counts may not be an appropriate indicator of successful AIL In conclusion, AR strategies promoting protein solubilization significantly reduced residual antigens compared to decellularization methods without compromising biomaterial functional properties. This study demonstrates the importance of solubilizing protein antigens for their removal in the generation of xenogeneic scaffolds. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Scaffold vascularization in vivo driven by primary human osteoblasts in
   concert with host inflammatory cells
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Successful cell-based tissue engineering requires a rapid and thorough vascularization in order to ensure long-term implant survival and tissue integration. The vascularization of a scaffold is a complex process, and is modulated by the presence of transplanted cells, exogenous and endogenous signaling proteins, and the host tissue reaction, among other influencing factors. This paper presents evidence for the significance of pre-seeded osteoblasts for the in vivo vascularization of a biodegradable scaffold. Human osteoblasts, cultured on silk fibroin micronets in vitro, migrated throughout the interconnected pores of the scaffold and produced extensive bone matrix. When these constructs were implanted in SCID mice, a rapid and thorough vascularization of the scaffold by the host blood capillaries occurred. This profound response was not seen for the silk fibroin scaffold alone. Moreover, when the pre-cultivation time of human osteoblasts was reduced from 14 days to only 24 h, the significant effect these cells exerted on vascularization rate in vivo was still detectable. From these studies, we conclude that matrix and soluble factors produced by osteoblasts can serve to instruct host endothelial cells to migrate, proliferate, and initiate the process of scaffold vascularization. This finding represents a potential paradigm shift for the field of tissue engineering, especially in bone, as traditional strategies to enhance scaffold vascularization have focused on endovascular cells and regarded osteoblasts primarily as cell targets for mineralization. In addition, the migration of host macrophages and multinucleated giant cells into the scaffold was also found to influence the vascularization of the biomaterial. Therefore, the robust effect on scaffold vascularization seen by pre-culturing with osteoblasts appears to occur in concert with the pro-angiogenic stimuli arising from host immune cells.

TI The stimulation of an osteogenic response by classical monocyte
   activation
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The monocyte/macrophage system plays a central role in host defense, wound healing and immune regulation at biomaterial surfaces. Monocytes can be classically and alternatively activated, and can be stimulated differently in response to variations in biomaterial surface properties. In this study, human monocytes, cultured on polystyrene surfaces (Ps), were activated either classically, by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or alternatively, by interleukin-4 (IL-4). Monocytes were also cultured on anodically oxidized (Ox) and machined (Ma) titanium surfaces, with and without LPS stimulation. Cells were cultured for 1 and 3 days and their conditioned media (CM) were collected. The osteogenic response of hMSCs to the monocyte CM was determined by analyzing the gene expression of key osteogenic markers. The CM from classically activated monocytes increased the hMSCs expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Furthermore, CM from monocytes cultured on Ox surface resulted in a modest increase of the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). LPS stimulation of the surface-seeded monocytes overwhelmed the effect of the surface properties and resulted in significant upregulation of BMP-2 and Runx2 for all samples. The results show that human monocytes, cultured on different surfaces and/or under different activation pathways, communicate pro-osteogenic signals to hMSCs. The signals involve regulation of autologous BMP-2 in the hMSCs. The classical activation results in profound and prolonged osteogenic effect compared to the effect of the investigated surface properties. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Mechanical and biological properties of keratose biomaterials
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The oxidized form of extractable human hair keratin proteins, commonly referred to as keratose, is gaining interest as a biomaterial for multiple tissue engineering studies including those directed toward peripheral nerve, spinal cord, skin, and bone regeneration. Unlike its disulfide cross-linked counterpart, kerateine, keratose does not possess a covalently cross-linked network structure and consequently displays substantially different characteristics. In order to understand its mode(s) of action and potential for clinical translatability, detailed characterization of the composition, physical properties, and biological responses of keratose biomaterials are needed. Keratose was obtained from end-cut human hair fibers by peracetic acid treatment, followed by base extraction, and subsequent dialysis. Analysis of lyophilized keratose powder determined that it contains 99% proteins by mass with amino acid content similar to human hair cortex. Metallic elements were also found in minute quantities. Protein oxidation led to disulfide bond cleavage and drastic reduction of free thiols due to conversion of sulfhydryl to sulfonic acid, chain fragmentation, and amino acid modifications. Mass spectrometry identified the major protein constituents as a heterogeneous mixture of 15 hair keratins (type I: K31-35 and K37-39, and type II: K81-86) with small amounts of epithelial keratins which exist in monomeric, dimeric, multimeric, and even degraded forms. Re-hydration with PBS enabled molecular assembly into an elastic solid-like hydrogel. Highly-porous scaffolds formed by lyophilization of the gel had the compression behavior of a cellular foam material and reverted back to gel upon wetting. Cytotoxicity assays showed that the EC50 for various cell lines were attained at 8-10 mg/mL keratose, indicating the non-toxic nature of the material. Implantation in mouse subcutaneous tissue pockets demonstrated that keratose resorption follows a rectangular hyperbolic regression with 92% degradation by an 8-week time point. Keratose was shown to integrate with the host tissue as evidenced by infiltration of leukocytes and fibroblasts, bulk material angiogenesis, and minimal fibrous encapsulation. Tissue response benchmarks were superior in keratose compared to the control PLGA 90:10 mesh. Finally, the degraded keratose was observed to remodel with the natural collagen extracellular matrix, verifying the benefit of using keratose as a temporary matrix for regenerative medicine applications.

TI Functional Restoration of Critically Sized Segmental Defects With Bone
   Morphogenetic Protein-2 and Heparin Treatment
SO CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH
AB Bone defects and fracture nonunions remain a substantial challenge for clinicians. Grafting procedures are limited by insufficient volume and donor site morbidity. As an alternative, biomaterial scaffolds functionalized through incorporation of growth factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have been developed and appear to regenerate the structure and function of damaged or degenerated skeletal tissue.
   Our objectives were therefore to determine whether: (1) the addition of heparin alone to collagen scaffolds sufficed to promote bone formation in vivo; (2) collagen-heparin scaffold improved BMP-mediated bone regeneration; and (3) precomplexed heparin and BMP-2 delivered on collagen scaffold could restore long bone biomechanical strength.
   We created bilateral surgical defects in the femora of 20 rats and filled the defects with PCL scaffolds with one of five treatments: collagen matrix (n = 5), collagen/heparin matrix (n = 7), collagen matrix + BMP-2 (n = 9), collagen/heparin matrix + BMP-2 (n = 9), or collagen matrix + BMP-2/heparin complex (n = 9). Bone formation was observed with radiographs and micro-CT analysis and biomechanical testing was used to assess strength.
   The addition of heparin alone to collagen did not promote bone ingrowth and the addition of heparin to collagen did not improve BMP-mediated bone regeneration. Delivery of precomplexed BMP-2 and heparin in a collagen matrix resulted in new bone formation with mechanical properties similar to those of intact bone.
   Our findings suggest delivery of precomplexed BMP-2 and heparin may be an advantageous strategy for treatment of clinically challenging bone defects.

TI Maintenance of hepatic differentiation by hepatocyte attachment peptides
   derived from laminin chains
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Hepatocytes rapidly lose hepatic functions upon isolation from liver, perhaps due to disrupted cell/matrix interactions. The matrix macromolecule laminin-111 consists of three chains, alpha 1, beta 1, and gamma 1; it is a major component of Matrigel, which can maintain hepatic differentiation. We previously showed that the A13 peptide (RQVFQVAYIIIKA, alpha 1 chain 121-133) derived from mouse laminin alpha 1 exhibits hepatocyte attachment activity and maintains hepatic differentiation. Here, we sought to identify hepatocyte adhesive sequences from the mouse laminin beta 1 and gamma 1 chains using 22 synthetic peptides that show biological activity for fibrosarcoma cells. Nine peptides showed hepatocyte attachment activity. Of these, B160 (VILQQSAADIAR, beta 1 chain 1607-1618), and C16 (KAFDITYVRLKF gamma 1 chain 139-150) exhibited the most potent activity. Hepatocytes cultured on both peptides also maintained expression of albumin, tyrosine aminotransferase, tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, and cytochrome P450. The morphology of hepatocytes on both peptides was a rounded shape typical for hepatic differentiation. We also characterized the nature of adhesion to the peptides. Heparin and EDTA inhibited cell attachment to both peptides, suggesting that hepatocyte attachment to the peptides was mediated by multiple receptors. The identification of active sequences regulating hepatic functions may facilitate the design of hepatocyte culture substrata that can regulate specific cellular behaviors in the context of a bioartificial liver.

TI Deposition of silicon doped and pure hydrogenated amorphous carbon
   coatings on quartz crystal microbalance sensors for protein adsorption
   studies
SO THIN SOLID FILMS
AB In this study hydrogenated amorphous carbon films (a-C:H) and silicon doped hydrogenated amorphous carbon films (a-C:H:Si) with different hydrogen and silicon contents were deposited onto sensors of a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation detection (QCM-D). The resulting films were investigated with regard to their structural and elemental compositions using Raman spectroscopy, elastic recoil detection analysis and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy. Furthermore the surface free energy (SFE) of the films was determined using contact angle measurements. The polar part of SFE of the a-C:H:Si films was found to be adjustable by the silicon content in these films and increased by increasing amounts of silicon. Carbon films with a broad range of chemical composition showed similar structure and properties when deposited on QCM-D sensors as compared with the deposition on silicon wafers. Subsequently, the amorphous carbon coated QCM-D sensors were used to study the adsorption of human serum albumin. These QCM-D results were related to the surface properties of the films.

AB Patients with malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) of B-cell lineages relapse despite initial anti-tumor response to chemotherapy or antibody treatments. Failure to eliminate the tumor is often because of inadequate priming, low cell numbers and suboptimal phenotype of effector T cells. Here we describe a new biomaterial-based controlled-release paradigm to treat weakly immunogenic NHLs by in-situ amplifying the number of functional, antigen-specific T-helper 1 (Th1) cells following immunotherapy. An injectable, synthetic immune priming center (sIPC) consisting of an in-situ crosslinking, chemokine-carrying hydrogel and both DNA-and siRNA dual-loaded microparticles, is reported. This sIPC chemo attracts a large number of immature dendritic cells (DCs) at the site of administration and efficiently co-delivers both DNA antigens and interleukin-10 (IL10)-silencing siRNA to those cells. Using a murine model of A20 B cell lymphoma, we demonstrate that combination of DNA-antigen delivery and IL10 silencing, synergistically activate recruited immature DCs and cause a strong shift towards Th1 response while suppressing Th2 and Th17 cytokines. sIPC-based immunotherapy showed 45% more CD8+ cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response and 53% stronger CD4+ CTL activity compared to naked DNA vaccine. In addition, in-vivo sIPC immunization induced significant protection (p<0.01) against subsequent tumor challenge. Such a multi-modal, injectable system that simultaneously delivers chemokines, siRNA and DNA antigens to DCs marks a new approach to in-situ priming and modulation during immunotherapy and could provide effective vaccination strategies against cancers and infectious diseases.

TI How Did the Spider Cross the River? Behavioral Adaptations for
   River-Bridging Webs in Caerostris darwini (Araneae: Araneidae)
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background: Interspecific coevolution is well described, but we know significantly less about how multiple traits coevolve within a species, particularly between behavioral traits and biomechanical properties of animals' "extended phenotypes''. In orb weaving spiders, coevolution of spider behavior with ecological and physical traits of their webs is expected. Darwin's bark spider (Caerostris darwini) bridges large water bodies, building the largest known orb webs utilizing the toughest known silk. Here, we examine C. darwini web building behaviors to establish how bridge lines are formed over water. We also test the prediction that this spider's unique web ecology and architecture coevolved with new web building behaviors.
   Methodology: We observed C. darwini in its natural habitat and filmed web building. We observed 90 web building events, and compared web building behaviors to other species of orb web spiders.
   Conclusions: Caerostris darwini uses a unique set of behaviors, some unknown in other spiders, to construct its enormous webs. First, the spiders release unusually large amounts of bridging silk into the air, which is then carried downwind, across the water body, establishing bridge lines. Second, the spiders perform almost no web site exploration. Third, they construct the orb capture area below the initial bridge line. In contrast to all known orb-weavers, the web hub is therefore not part of the initial bridge line but is instead built de novo. Fourth, the orb contains two types of radial threads, with those in the upper half of the web doubled. These unique behaviors result in a giant, yet rather simplified web. Our results continue to build evidence for the coevolution of behavioral (web building), ecological (web microhabitat) and biomaterial (silk biomechanics) traits that combined allow C. darwini to occupy a unique niche among spiders.

TI Synthesis of pH-Sensitive Particles for Local Delivery of an Antibiotic
   via Dispersion ROMP
SO MACROMOLECULES
AB The synthesis and the in vitro antibacterial activity of pH-sensitive functionalized nanoparticles for the local delivery of antibiotic are described. Nanoparticles (NPs) are formed by ring-opening metathesis copolymerization (ROMP) in dispersed medium of norbomene (Nb) with a,od-functionalized macromonomers. Macromonomers are ended with gentamicin sulfate (GS) or carboxylic acid groups. GS, linked thanks to a pH-sensitive bond, can be released in acidic medium whereas acidic function allows the future covalent grafting of these NPs onto biomaterial surface in order to synthesize innovating GS-loaded biomaterials. In this paper, we focused on the synthesis and the characterization of biofunctional NPs and their in vitro antibacterial activities. NPs have been synthesized with a controlled rate of GS and their stability in aqueous medium has been proved. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements using Staphylococcus epidermidis as bacterial strain after the GS release at acidic pH have permitted us to prove the efficiency of this system.

TI Non-isothermal crystallization kinetics and dynamic mechanical thermal
   properties of poly(butylene succinate) composites reinforced with cotton
   stalk bast fibers
SO THERMOCHIMICA ACTA
AB Degradable poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) was reinforced with cotton stalk bast fibers (CSBF) which had been pre-treated by the continuous steam explosion method. The non-isothermal crystallization kinetics, crystalline structure and spherulitic morphology of neat PBS and CSBF/PBS composites were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and polarizing optical microscopy (POM). Moreover, the dynamic mechanical thermal properties of neat PBS and CSBF/PBS composites were studied by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMA). The results showed that CSBF played a dual role for acting as both nucleating agents to promote nucleation and physical hindrances to retard the transport of chain segments during the non-isothermal crystallization. In non-isothermal crystallization kinetics, the Ozawa model failed to describe the crystallization behavior of these systems, while Avrami model and Liu model (modified Avrami-Ozawa model) were found applicable. Though the spherulites drastically decreased in size when CSBF were added into PBS matrix, the crystalline structure did not change. In addition, the presence of CSBF largely enhanced the storage modulus of PBS matrix. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Bioseparation of Pb(II) and Cd(II) from aqueous solution using cork
   waste biomass. Modeling and optimization of the parameters of the
   biosorption step
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this work the ability of cork wastes to remove Cd(II) and Pb(II) from aqueous solutions has been studied. The kinetics of the biosorption system, the influence of the aqueous pH and the initial metal concentration on the metal uptake were investigated, showing a pH dependent profile. The maximum sorption for both metals was found at pH 5, independently that if the metals were in individual solutions or mixed. When a solution of the mixed metals were studied, a reduction in the Cd(II) uptake was observed showing a clear competition between the metals which was corroborated by the P-factor approach, behavior probably due to a lower attraction of this metal towards the corresponding active groups of the cork. Finally, the cork has been evaluated by FTIR and SEM in order to determine if the biosorption process modifies its chemical structure and morphology, respectively. Cork has been proved to be an efficient biomaterial useful for heavy metal separation purposes that is not altered by the process. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Artificial antibodies for troponin T by its imprinting on the surface of
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes: Its use as sensory surfaces
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB A novel artificial antibody for troponin T (TnT) was synthesized by molecular imprint (MI) on the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). This was done by attaching TnT to the MWCNT surface, and filling the vacant spaces by polymerizing under mild conditions acrylamide (monomer) in N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (cross-linker) and ammonium persulphate (initiator). After removing the template, the obtained biomaterial was able to rebind TnT and discriminate it among other interfering species. Stereochemical recognition of TnT was confirmed by the non-rebinding ability displayed by non-imprinted (NI) materials, obtained by imprinting without a template. SEM and FTIR analysis confirmed the surface modification of the MWCNT. The ability of this biomaterial to rebind TnT was confirmed by including it as electroactive compound in a PVC/plasticizer mixture coating a wire of silver, gold or titanium. Anionic slopes of 50 mV decade(-1) were obtained for the gold wire coated with MI-based membranes dipped in HEPES buffer of pH 7. The limit of detection was 0.16 mu g mL(-1). Neither the NI-MWCNT nor the MWCNT showed the ability to recognize the template. Good selectivity was observed against creatinine, sucrose, fructose, myoglobin, sodium glutamate, thiamine and urea. The sensor was tested successfully on serum samples. It is expected that this work opens new horizons on the design of new artificial antibodies for complex protein structures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The gated lateral BIT can function as both a BJT and a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) with both the emitter and source, and the collector and drain, coupled. C-reactive protein (CRP), which is an important disease marker in clinical examinations, can be detected using the proposed device. In the MOSFET-BJT hybrid mode, the sensitivity, selectivity, and reproducibility of the gated lateral BIT for biosensors were evaluated in this study. According to the results, in the MOSFET-BJT hybrid mode, the gated lateral BJT shows good selectivity and reproducibility. Changes in the emitter (source) current of the device for CRP antigen detection were approximately 0.65, 0.72, and 0.80 mu A/decade at base currents of -50, -30, and -10 mu A, respectively. The proposed device has significant application in the detection of certain biomaterials that require a dilution process using a common biosensor, such as a MOSFET-based biosensor.

TI Electrochemical stability of TiO2 nanotubes with different diameters in
   artificial saliva
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Recently, titanium and titanium alloys with nanotube layers by anodizing process have gained great interests as surgical implant materials. In this present paper, their electrochemical stability of self-organized TiO2 nanotubue layers prepared by anodization of pure Ti in 0.5 wt.% hydrofluoric acid has been investigated in simulated biological environment by use of open-circuit potential (OCP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization tests. The electrochemical testing results indicate that the nanotubular Ti with the diameter of TiO2 nanotube lower than 86 nm shows a better corrosion resistance in artificial saliva than that of the mechanically polished Ti. Moreover, the electrochemical stability of Ti nanotubes 22 to 59 nm in diameter is improved but that of Ti nanotubes larger than 86 nm decreases. Besides, the corrosion attack of the nanotubular Ti is shown by the collapse of TiO2 nanotubue layer. The results suggest that the electrochemical corrosion behavior of nanotubular Ti in artificial saliva is related to the diameter of the nanotubes and thickness of the barrier layer.

TI Periodate oxidized alginates: Depolymerization kinetics
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB Limited periodate oxidation (0-8%) of alginates results in enhanced degradability, extending the range of applications of alginates as biomaterials, e.g. in tissue engineering. Oxidation produces dialdehydes that are highly sensitive to alkaline beta-elimination, even under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 degrees C). Although all periodate is consumed during limited oxidation, not all of the resulting dialdehydes are equally degradable, leading to a characteristic level off in molecular weight upon prolonged degradation. A significant fraction (20-50%) of the oxidized residues were resistant even at pH 10.4. We tentatively assign this finding to the presence of particularly stable intramolecular hemiacetals known to form in periodate oxidized alginates (PGA). The enhanced degradation of POA persists into the gel state, allowing tailoring of more biodegradable alginate gels. The activation energy for beta-elimination of dialdehydes was 88 kJ/mol compared to 113 kJ/mol for unoxidized residues, presumably reflecting the absence of strain in the non-cyclic transition state of the former.

TI Homogeneous synthesis of hemicellulosic succinates with high degree of
   substitution in ionic liquid
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB Chemical modification is the most important means to obtain novel biopolymers and biomaterials from the abundant biomacromolecules. In this paper, hemicellulosic succinate, which is very important biomacromolecule for the preparation of functional materials, was homogeneously prepared in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl) ionic liquid. The influence of reaction conditions used in this work on the degree of substitution (DS) was investigated, and the chemical structure and the thermal stability of hemicellulosic succinate were characterized by FT-IR and (13)C NMR spectroscopies as well as thermogravimetry. A high DS of up to 1.80 could be achieved at short time scale in [BMIM]Cl ionic liquid without any catalysts, which is probably due to the excellent dissolving capacity and catalytic effect of ionic liquid. These results indicate that ionic liquids open up totally new opportunities for chemically functionalization of hemicelluloses. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Optimization of Electrospun Polylactide-Based Ultrathin Fibers for
   Osteoconductive Bone Scaffolds
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB Bone tissue interfacial scaffolds, which encourage cell growth, are critical determinants for clinical success after implant surgery. Over the years, a number of resorbable configurations have emerged for bone cell support and growth, but only a few have demonstrated clinical efficacy. Polymer coatings produced by electrospinning are regarded as very promising bone interfaces because of the ultrathin-scaled dimensions of its physical structure. In this study, the morphology, composition, thermal properties, and cell growth viability of a number of polylactide-based systems containing different binary and ternary formulations of this biomaterial with collagen and commercial hydroxyapatite nanoparticles were characterized. The best performance in terms of biocompatibility was obtained for the tricomponent system in which the submicron fibers were further subjected to uniaxial orientation process during formation. The in vitro proliferation of the cells, which harbored on these ultrathin-structured mats, was examined by means of a metabolic activity indicator and ensured by means of scanning electron microscopy, and cell anchorage was checked by fluorescent optical microscopy. Finally, the optimum tricomponent material was successfully sterilized for the first time by gamma radiation without noticeable losses in cell-seeding capacity. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Partial nephrectomy using porcine small intestinal submucosa
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
AB Background: Whenever technically feasible and oncologically justified, nephron-sparing surgery is the current standard of care for localized renal cell carcinomas (RCC). The main complications of partial nephrectomy, especially for large and centrally located tumors, are urinary leakage and parenchymal bleeding. We prospectively evaluated the pros and cons of using porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS, Surgisis (R)) to close the renal defect after nephron-sparing surgery.
   Methods: We used Surgisis (R) (Cook medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) to secure and compress the capsular defect after tumor resection in 123 patients submitted to 129 partial nephrectomies between August 2003 and February 2011.
   Results: The median tumor size was 3.7 cm (range 1.1-13.0 cm). Procedures were performed with cold ischemia in 24 cases (18.2%), with warm ischemia in 46 (35.6%), and without ischemia in 59 cases (44.8%). In the total group of patients, 4 (3.1%) developed urinary fistula, and only 2 (1.6%) required postoperative transfusions due to hemorrhage after the application of the small intestinal submucosa membrane.
   Conclusion: Small intestinal submucosa is an easy-to-use biomaterial for preventing complications such as postoperative bleeding and urinary fistula in nephron-sparing surgery, especially in cases where tumor excision causes significant renal capsular and/or renal pelvic defects.

TI Poly(Vinyl Alcohol) Physical Hydrogels: New Vista on a Long Serving
   Biomaterial
SO MACROMOLECULAR BIOSCIENCE
AB Poly(vinyl alcohol), PVA, and physical hydrogels derived thereof have an excellent safety profile and a successful history of biomedical applications. However, these materials are hardly in the focus of biomedical research, largely due to poor opportunities in nano- and micro-scale design associated with PVA hydrogels in their current form. In this review we aim to demonstrate that with PVA, a (sub) molecular control over polymer chemistry translates into fine-tuned supramolecular association of chains and this, in turn, defines macroscopic properties of the material. This nano- to micro- to macro- translation of control is unique for PVA and can now be accomplished using modern tools of macromolecular design. We believe that this strategy affords functionalized PVA physical hydrogels which meet the demands of modern nanobiotechnology and have a potential to become an indispensable tool in the design of biomaterials.

TI Poly(Lactic Acid)/Layered Silicate Nanocomposite Films: Morphology,
   Mechanical Properties, and Effects of gamma-Radiation
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB Poly(Lactic acid) (PLA)-layered silicate nanocomposite films were prepared by solvent casting method. The films were irradiated with Co(60) radiation facility at dose of 30 kGy. The effect of gamma irradiation on mechanical properties of the neat PLA and nanocomposites was evaluated by data obtained from tensile testing measurements. The tensile strength of the irradiated PLA films increased with addition of 1 wt % triallyl cyanurate indicating crosslink formation. Significant ductile behavior was observed in the PLA nanocomposites containing 4 pph of nanoclay. Incorporation of nanoclay particles in the PLA matrix stimulated crystal growth as it was studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The morphology of the nanocomposites characterized by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction revealed an exfoliated morphology in the PLA nanocomposite films containing 4 pph of nanoclay. Only very small changes were observed in the chemical structure of the irradiated samples as it was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Development of Porous Lamellar Chitosan-Alginate Membranes: Effect of
   Different Surfactants on Biomaterial Properties
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB In this work, porous lamellar chitosan-alginate membranes were developed without the use of freeze-drying methods or other vacuum-based approaches. The effects of two different surfactants, Tween 80 and Pluronic F68, on the properties of the membranes were evaluated, aiming at the production of stable consistent foams with improved polysaccharide dispersion. The membranes prepared with Tween 80 had a tensile strength around 1.5 MPa, elongation at break of 2.1% and liquid uptake from 590 to 1370% in distinct solutions, increasing their thickness in up to 3.9 times when immersed in water. The membranes obtained with Pluronic F68 had a tensile strength of 1.0 MPa, elongation at break of 2.0% and liquid uptake from 774 to 1380%, showing an increase in thickness around 3.2 times after exposure to water. The antimicrobial properties of both membranes were also evaluated, showing that despite being porous, the membranes can provide some protection against bacterial permeation. Therefore, membranes produced with Tween 80 and Pluronic F68 were considered to have high potential for use in the production of wound dressings and scaffolds for tissue engineering.

TI Volumetric wear assessment of failed metal-on-metal hip resurfacing
   prostheses
SO WEAR
AB Recent advancements in hip arthroplasty have allowed the operation to boast excellent results and high survivorship. However, failures do still occur and a major cause is complications arising from wear debris. It is essential therefore that debris is minimized by reducing wear at the bearing surface. One proposed method of achieving this wear reduction is through the use of metal-on-metal articulations. One of the latest manifestations of this biomaterial combination is in designs of hip resurfacing which are aimed at younger, more active patients who might wear out a conventional metal-on-polymer hip prosthesis. However, do these metal-on-metal hip resurfacings show less wear when implanted into patients?
   Using a co-ordinate measuring machine and a bespoke computer program, volumetric wear measurements for retrieved Articular Surface Replacements (ASR (TM), DePuy) metal-on-metal hip resurfacings were undertaken. Thirty-two femoral heads and twenty-two acetabular cups were measured. Acetabular cups exhibited mean volumetric wear of 29.00 mm(3) (range 1.35-109.72 mm(3)) and a wear rate of 11.02 mm(3)/year (range 0.30-63.59 mm(3)/year). Femoral heads exhibited mean wear of 22.41 mm(3) (range 0.72-134.22 mm(3)) and a wear rate of 8.72 mm(3)/year (range 0.21-31.91 mm(3)/year). In the 22 cases where both head and cup from the same prosthesis were available, mean total wear rates of 21.66 mm(3)/year (range 0.51-95.50 mm(3)/year) were observed. Compared with in many vitro tests, these are significantly higher than those expected in a well functioning metal-on-metal hip resurfacing prosthesis and are of concern. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

SO BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA
AB Various chondrogenic growth factors have been shown to promote proliferation, matrix production and early chondrogenesis of intervertebral disc (IVD). The objective of this study is to reconstruct IVD via tissue engineering technique and to evaluate in-vitro chondrogenesis of chondrocytes cultured in basic growth medium with chondrogenic growth factors (FDGFs) and without chondrogenic growth factors (FD). The annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP) were aseptically dissected from the lumbar discs of sheep and the tissues enzymatically digested and cultured in-vitro. Passage 1 cells were used to form in-vitro construct with autologous fibrin as the biomaterial. All constructs were stabilized for 14 days in their respective growth media. Histological and sulphated-glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) analysis were performed at the end of the experiment. The AF cells showed greater growth kinetic profile and higher viability in FDGFs while the NP cells showed no differences for both medium. The construct of AF and NP in FDGFs showed a bigger size construct compared to FD. The qualities of both constructs were similar as evidence by Safranin O staining in both groups. In conclusion, FDGFs increase the viability and quantity of cells for AF and not in NP. However, FDGFs supplementation improved in-vitro constructs formation for both cells type.

TI Fatigue Properties on the Failure Mode of a Dental Implant in a
   Simulated Body Environment
SO METALS AND MATERIALS INTERNATIONAL
AB This study undertook a fatigue test in a simulated body environment that has reflected the conditions (such as the body fluid conditions, the micro-current of cell membranes, and the chewing force) within a living body. First, the study sought to evaluate the fatigue limit under normal conditions and in a simulated body environment, looking into the governing factors of implant fatigue strength through an observation of the fracture mode. In addition, the crack initiation behavior of a tungsten-carbide-coated abutment screw was examined. The fatigue limit of an implant within the simulated body environment decreased by 19 % compared to the limit noted under normal conditions. Several corrosion pits were observed on the abutment screw after the fatigue test in the simulated body environment. For the model used in this study, the implant fracture was mostly governed by the fatigue failure of the abutment screw; accordingly, the influence by the fixture on the fatigue strength of the implant was noted to be low. For the abutment screw coated with tungsten carbide, several times the normal amount of stress was found to be concentrated on the contact part due to the elastic interaction between the coating material and the base material.

TI Microstructure and Biocompatibility of Titanium Oxides Produced on
   Nitrided Surface Layer Under Glow Discharge Conditions
SO JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The disadvantages of titanium implants are their low wear resistance and the release of titanium elements into surrounding tissue. These can be eliminated by modifying the surface by surface engineering methods, among them nitriding under glow discharge conditions which allow to produce diffusive surface layers. Their combining with an oxide layer might be valuable for biological events occurring at the bone implant interface. The aim of this study was to enhance the titanium biomaterial performance via combining nitriding and oxidizing treatments in one process under glow discharge conditions. The oxynitrided surface layers were produced at 680 C. The obtained layer was TiO + TiN + Ti(2)N + alpha Ti(N) type and about 4-mu m thick and was of diffusive character. This layer significantly increased wear resistance and slightly corrosion resistance compared to that of the reference titanium alloy. The produced titanium oxide was about 400-nm thick and built from fine crystallites. This oxide exhibits bioactivity in SBF (simulated body fluid). Osteoblasts of Saos-2 line incubated on this surface exhibited good adhesion and proliferation and ALP release comparable with cells cultured on the reference titanium alloy and TiN + Ti(2)N + alpha Ti(N) surface layers. A quantitative analysis of blood platelets adhering to this layer revealed their highest amount in comparison to that on both the nitrided surface layer and titanium alloy. The presented study provided a simple and reproducible method of combining oxidizing and nitriding under glow discharge in one process. Experimental data in vitro suggests that titanium alloy oxynitriding under low temperatures at glow discharge conditions improves titanium alloy properties and biocompatibility and tissue healing. Therefore, the layer of TiO TiN + Ti(2)N + alpha Ti(N) type could be valuable for long-term bone implants.

Many of these bone graft substitute alternatives include ceramic-based, allograft-based, factor-based and polymer-based whereas others are cell-based. The ways of achieving the goal of tissue engineering using stem cells and their lineage to regenerate tissue have been detailed with regard to both the generation of sufficient vascular invasion of the tissue to improve oxygen and nutrient supply, and the development of innovative physical/chemical stimuli to induce bone formation with the proper biomaterial to carry the cells. It is imperative to integrate basic polymer science with molecular biology and stem cell biology, in the design of new materials that perform very sophisticated signaling needed for integration and function.

TI Hyaluronan and Fibrin Biomaterial as Scaffolds for Neuronal
   Differentiation of Adult Stem Cells Derived from Adipose Tissue and Skin
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Recently, we have described a simple protocol to obtain an enriched culture of adult stem cells organized in neurospheres from two post-natal tissues: skin and adipose tissue. Due to their possible application in neuronal tissue regeneration, here we tested two kinds of scaffold well known in tissue engineering application: hyaluronan based membranes and fibrin-glue meshes. Neurospheres from skin and adipose tissue were seeded onto two scaffold types: hyaluronan based membrane and fibrin-glue meshes. Neurospheres were then induced to acquire a glial and neuronal-like phenotype. Gene expression, morphological feature and chromosomal imbalance (kariotype) were analyzed and compared. Adipose and skin derived neurospheres are able to grow well and to differentiate into glial/neuron cells without any chromosomal imbalance in both scaffolds. Adult cells are able to express typical cell surface markers such as S100; GFAP; nestin; beta III tubulin; CNPase. In summary, we have demonstrated that neurospheres isolated from skin and adipose tissues are able to differentiate in glial/neuron-like cells, without any chromosomal imbalance in two scaffold types, useful for tissue engineering application: hyaluronan based membrane and fibrin-glue meshes.

Amongst these polymeric surfaces, the maximum biofilm formation was recorded to be 64.19, 50.31, and 45.09% for PS, PP, SR, respectively in comparison to PVC after 48 h using XTT [2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium-carboxanilide] tetrazolium reduction assay. Exopolysaccharides (EPS) production during biofilm formation, when assessed using acetone precipitation technique, was found to be 11.45, 9.41, 8.65 and 6.95 mu g/cm(2) for PVC, PS, PP and SR, respectively. Atomic force microscopic and goniometric analysis showed maximum roughness (134 nm) and hydrophobicity (97 degrees) for PVC. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) studies revealed maximum biofilm thickness (117.5 mu m) on PVC surface when analyzed by z-sectioning. Further, the data were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for biofilm growth on these biomaterials. It was observed that PVC as biomaterial is most susceptible for C. albicans biofilm formation, while material surface properties like roughness and hydrophobicity promotes C. albicans adhesion and biofilm development.

TI Patient-to-Patient Variability in Autologous Pericardial Matrix
   Scaffolds for Cardiac Repair
SO JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
AB The pursuit of alternate therapies for end-stage heart failure post-myocardial infarction has led to the development of a variety of in situ gelling materials to be used as cellular or acellular scaffolds for cardiac repair. Previously, a protocol was established to decellularize human and porcine pericardia and process the extracellular matrix (ECM) into an injectable form. The resulting gels were found to retain components of the native extracellular matrix; cell infiltration was facilitated in vivo, and neovascularization was observed by 2 weeks. However, the assertion that an injectable form of human pericardial tissue could be a potentially autologous scaffold for myocardial tissue engineering requires assessment of the patient-to-patient variability. With this work, seven human pericardia from a relevant patient demographic are processed into injectable matrix materials that gel when brought to physiologic conditions. The resulting materials are compared with respect to their protein composition, glycosaminoglycan content, in vitro degradation, in vivo gelation, and microstructure. It is observed that a diminished collagen content in a subset of samples prevents in vitro gelation but not in vivo gelation at lower ECM concentrations. The structure is similarly fibrous and porous across all samples, implying the cell infiltration may be similarly facilitated. The biochemical composition as characterized by tandem mass spectrometry is comparable; basic ECM components are conserved across all samples, and the presence of a wide variety of ECM proteins and glycoproteins demonstrate the retention of biochemical complexity post-processing. It is concluded that the variability within human pericardial tissue specimens does not prevent them from being processed into injectable scaffolds; therefore, pericardial tissue offers a promising source as an autologous, injectable biomaterial scaffold.

TI Bioengineering the Infarcted Heart by Applying Bio-inspired Materials
SO JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
AB Induction of cardiac muscle regeneration following myocardial infarction (MI) represents a major challenge in cardiovascular therapy, as the current clinical approaches are limited in their ability to regenerate a new muscle tissue and to replace infarcted myocardium. Here, we describe the conception of two strategies based on bio-inspired materials, aimed at myocardial repair after MI. In the first strategy, alginate biomaterial was designed with affinity-binding moieties, enabling the binding of heparin-binding proteins and their controlled presentation and release. The combined features of this unique alginate hydrogel, as a temporary extracellular matrix replacement and a depot for bio-molecules such as insulin-like growth factor-1 and hepatocyte growth factor, led to improvements in cardiac structure and function, as demonstrated by the biomaterial's abilities to thicken the scar and prevent left-ventricular remodeling and dilatation. Endogenous regeneration occurring at the infarct as manifested by the enhanced angiogenesis, cardiomyocyte proliferation, and appearance of cardiac-related stem cells is likely to have contributed to this. In the second strategy, phosphatidylserine (PS)-presenting liposomes were developed to mimic apoptotic cells bodies, specifically their capability of immunomodulating activated macrophages into anti-inflammatory state. In a rat model of acute MI, targeting of PS-presenting liposomes to infarct macrophages after injection via the femoral vein was demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging. The treatment promoted angiogenesis, the preservation of small scars, and prevention of ventricular dilatation and remodeling. Collectively, the two bio-inspired material-based strategies presented herein represent unique and clinical accessible approaches for myocardial infarct repair.

TI Hybrid Gel Composed of Native Heart Matrix and Collagen Induces Cardiac
   Differentiation of Human Embryonic Stem Cells without Supplemental
   Growth Factors
SO JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
AB Our goal was to assess the ability of native heart extracellular matrix (ECM) to direct cardiac differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in vitro. In order to probe the effects of cardiac matrix on hESC differentiation, a series of hydrogels was prepared from decellularized ECM from porcine hearts by mixing ECM and collagen type I at varying ratios. Maturation of cardiac function in embryoid bodies formed from hESCs was documented in terms of spontaneous contractile behavior and the mRNA and protein expression of cardiac markers. Hydrogel with high ECM content (75% ECM, 25% collagen, no supplemental soluble factors) increased the fraction of cells expressing cardiac marker troponin T, when compared with either hydrogel with low ECM content (25% ECM, 75% collagen, no supplemental soluble factors) or collagen hydrogel (100% collagen, with supplemental soluble factors). Furthermore, cardiac maturation was promoted in high-ECM content hydrogels, as evidenced by the striation patterns of cardiac troponin I and by upregulation of Cx43 gene. Consistently, high-ECM content hydrogels improved the contractile function of cardiac cells, as evidenced by increased numbers of contracting cells and increased contraction amplitudes. The ability of native ECM hydrogel to induce cardiac differentiation of hESCs without the addition of soluble factors makes it an attractive biomaterial system for basic studies of cardiac development and potentially for the delivery of therapeutic cells into the heart.

TI Sensing the Cardiac Environment: Exploiting Cues for Regeneration
SO JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
AB Recent pre-clinical and clinical studies indicate that certain exogenous stem cells and biomaterials can preserve cardiac tissue after myocardial infarction. Regarding stem cells, a growing body of data suggests that the short-term positive outcomes are mainly attributed to paracrine signaling mechanisms. The release of such factors is due to the cell's ability to sense cardiac environmentally derived cues, though the exact feedback loops are still poorly understood. However, given the limited engraftment and survival of transplanted cells in the ischemic environment, the long-term clinical benefits of these therapies have not yet been realized. To overcome this, the long-term controlled delivery of bioactive factors using biomaterials is a promising approach. A major challenge has been the ability to develop timely and spatially controlled gradients of different cues, pivotal for the development and regeneration of tissues. In addition, given the complexity of the remodeling process after myocardial infarction, multiple factors may be required at distinct disease stages to maximize therapeutic outcomes. Therefore, novel smart materials that can sense the surrounding environment and generate cues through on demand mechanisms will be of major importance in the translation of these promising advanced therapies. This article reviews how the cardiac environment can mediate the release profiles of bioactive cues from cells and biomaterials and how the controlled delivery impacts heart regeneration.

TI Tissue engineering tools for modulation of the immune response
SO BIOTECHNIQUES
AB Tissue engineering scaffolds have emerged as a powerful tool within regenerative medicine. These materials are being designed to create environments that promote regeneration through a combination of: (i) scaffold architecture, (ii) the use of scaffolds as vehicles for transplanting progenitor cells, and/or (iii) localized delivery of inductive factors or genes encoding for these inductive factors. This review describes the techniques associated with each of these components. Additionally, the immune response is increasingly recognized as a factor influencing regeneration. The immune reaction to an implant begins with an acute response to the injury and innate recognition of foreign materials, with the subsequent chronic immune response involving specific recognition of antigens (e.g., transplanted cells) by the adaptive immune response, which can eventually lead to rejection of the implant. Thus, we also describe the impact of each component on the immune response, and strategies (e.g., material design, anti-inflammatory cytokine delivery, and immune cell recruitment/transplantation) to modulate, yet not eliminate, the local immune response in order to promote regeneration, which represents another important tool for regenerative medicine.

TI New approach to border line evaluations for whole sample of Williams
   pear (Pyrus communis)
SO COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
AB In many processes of heat exchange, as well as in other processes of biomaterial handling, physical properties of fruit such as dimensions, shape, surface area and volume are of crucial importance. The objective of this work was to find a function which approximates pear border line, as precisely as possible, in order to calculate the surface area and volume of a pear by means of integral calculus. Previously described estimation of an average pear border line was based on the sixth order polynomial and proposed algorithm. Two new ways to calculate the Williams pear border line are the focus of this study. The first way includes spline functions as an estimation of a pear border line (i.e. four third order polynomials), while the second one uses regression function obtained by nonlinear regression method. The regression function has two independent variables, length and total length of a pear. The most precise approximation of a pear border line was obtained by nonlinear regression with R(2) = 97.48. This was more obvious when total pear length was smaller or greater than average total pear length. Border lines of all tested pears were determined by one regression function with large precision. Therefore, it is safe to calculate surface area and volume of a pear based on regression function and total pear length, only. Calculated volumes of the pears were compared with volumes measured by Archimedes' method. The smallest relative error has been obtained when the volumes were calculated using the regression function as approximation of pear border line. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI In vivo tissue engineering of musculoskeletal tissues
SO CURRENT OPINION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Tissue engineering of musculoskeletal tissues often involves the in vitro manipulation and culture of progenitor cells, growth factors and biomaterial scaffolds. Though in vitro tissue engineering has greatly increased our understanding of cellular behavior and cell-material interactions, this methodology is often unable 10 recreate tissue with the hierarchical organization and vascularization found within native tissues. Accordingly, investigators have focused on alternative in vivo tissue engineering strategies, whereby the traditional triad (cells, growth factors, scaffolds) or a combination thereof are directly implanted at the damaged tissue site or within ectopic sites capable of supporting neo-tissue formation. In vivo tissue engineering may offer a preferential route for regeneration of musculoskeletal and other tissues with distinct advantages over in vitro methods based on the specific location of endogenous cultivation, recruitment of autologous cells, and patient-specific regenerated tissues.

TI Infection and tissue engineering in segmental bone defects - a mini
   review
SO CURRENT OPINION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB As tissue engineering becomes more of a clinical reality through the ongoing bench to bedside transition, research in this field must focus on addressing relevant clinical situations. Although most in vivo work in the area of bone tissue engineering focuses on bone regeneration within sterile, surgically created defects, there is a growing need for the investigation of bone tissue engineering approaches within contaminated or scarred wound beds, such as those that may be encountered following traumatic injury or during delayed reconstruction/regeneration. Significant work has been performed in the area of local drug delivery via biomaterial carriers, but there is little intersection in the available literature between antibiotic delivery and tissue regeneration. In this review, we examine recent advances in segmental bone defect animal models, bone tissue engineering, and drug delivery with the goal of identifying promising approaches and areas needing further investigation towards developing both a better understanding of and new tissue engineering approaches for addressing infection control while simultaneously initiating bone regeneration.

Targeting is based on overexpression of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor in the infarcted heart. Liposomes 142 nm in diameter were conjugated with a ligand specific to AT1. The nanoparticles were able to specifically target cardiac cells in vitro, and in the infarcted heart after intravenous injection in vivo. This system may be useful for delivering therapeutic agents specifically to the infarcted heart.

SO ACS CATALYSIS
AB Novozym 435-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of trimethylene carbonate (TMC) with telechelic hydroxylated poly[(R)-3-hydroxybytyrate][PHB-diol; M(n) = 3000 g/mol (GPC)] as initiator gave di-block poly(HB-co-TMC) with different weight percents of the blocks and M(n) of 4400-8700 g/mol (GPC) in 54-89% yield, being the first enzymatic preparation of block poly(ester-co-carbonate). The generality of the novel enzymatic method was demonstrated by the enzymatic ROP of TMC with poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-diol [PCL-diol; Mn of 4200 g/mol (GPC)] to give A-B-A tri-block-poly(TMC-co-CL-co-TMC) with different weight percents of the 67% yield. The prepared block poly(ester-co-carbonate) with two terminal hydroxyl groups was proven to be a useful starting material for the further preparation of thermoplastic block copolymers. Polymerization of di-block poly(24 wt % HB-co-76 wt % TMC) with methylene diphenyl-4-4'-diisocyanate (MDI) afforded the corresponding polyurethane with M(n) of 53 800 g/mol (GPC) in 94% yield. The polymer showed excellent thermoplastic properties (T(m) of 144 and 152 degrees C, T(g) of -9 degrees C, epsilon(b) of 252%, sigma(max) of 6.37 MPa, and E of 23 MPa), being potentially useful for soft tissue engineering.

TI Tuning the dependency between stiffness and permeability of a cell
   encapsulating hydrogel with hydrophilic pendant chains
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB The mechanical stiffness of a hydrogel plays a significant role in regulating the phenotype of cells that adhere to its surface. However, the effect of hydrogel stiffness on cells cultured within its matrix is not well understood, because of the intrinsic inverse dependency between the permeability and stiffness of hydrogels. This study therefore presents an advanced biomaterial design strategy to decrease the inverse dependency between permeability and stiffness of a cell encapsulating hydrogel. Hydrogels were made by cross-linking poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and poly(ethylene glycol) monoacrylate (PEGMA), with PEGMA acting as a pendant polymer chain. Increasing the mass fraction of PEGMA while keeping the total polymer concentration constant led to a decrease in the elastic modulus (E) of the hydrogel, but caused a minimal increase in the swelling ratio (Q). The size and hydrophobicity of the end groups of pendant PEG chains further fine tuned the dependency between Q and E of the hydrogel. Pure PEGDA hydrogels with varying molecular weights, which show the same range of E but a much greater range of Q were used as a control. Fibroblasts encapsulated in PEGDA-PEGMA hydrogels displayed more significant biphasic dependencies of cell viability and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression on E than those encapsulated in pure PEGDA hydrogels, which were greatly influenced by Q. Overall, the hydrogel design strategy presented in this study will be highly useful to better regulate the phenotype and ultimately improve the therapeutic efficacy of a wide array of cells used in various biology studies and clinical settings.

TI Assessment of angiogenesis in osseointegration of a silica-collagen
   biomaterial using 3D-nano-CT
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB Bony integration of biomaterials is a complex process in which angiogenesis plays a crucial role. We evaluated micro- and nano-CT imaging to demonstrate and quantify neovascularization in bony integration of a biomaterial and to give an image based estimation for the needed resolution for imaging angiogenesis in an animal model of femora defect healing. In 8 rats 5 mm full-size defects were created at the left femur that was filled with silica-collagen bone substitute material and internally fixed with plate osteosynthesis. After 6 weeks the femora were infused in situ with Microfil, harvested and scanned for micro-CT (9 mu m)(3) and nano-CT (3 mu m)(3) imaging. Using those 3D images, the newly formed blood vessels in the area of the biomaterial were assessed and the total vascular volume fraction, the volume of the bone substitute material and the volume of the bone defect were quantitatively characterized. Results were complemented by histology. Differences were statistically assessed using (ANOVA). High-resolution nano-CT demonstrated new blood vessel formation surrounding the biomaterial in all animals at capillary level. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the newly formed blood vessels surrounding the bone substitute material. The mean vascular volume fraction (VVF) around the implant was calculated to be 3.01 +/- 0.4%. The VVF was inversely correlated with the volume of the bone substitute material (r = 0.8) but not with the dimension of the fracture zone (r = 0.3). Nano-CT imaging is feasible for quantitative analysis of angiogenesis during bony integration of biomaterials and a promising tool in this context for the future. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB Honeybees produce silken cocoons containing four related fibrous proteins. High levels of each of the honeybee silk proteins can be produced recombinantly by fermentation in Escherichia coli. In this study we have used electrospinning to fabricate a single recombinant honeybee silk protein, AmelF3, into nanofibers of around 200 nm diameter. Infrared spectroscopy found that the molecular structure of the nanofibers was predominantly coiled coil, essentially the same as native honeybee silk. Mats of the honeybee nanofibers were treated with methanol or by water annealing, which increased their beta-sheet content and rendered them water insensitive. The insoluble mats were degraded by protease on a time scale of hours to days. The protease gradually released proteins from the solid state and these were subsequently rapidly degraded into small peptides without the accumulation of partial degradation products. Cell culture assays demonstrated that the mats allowed survival, attachment and proliferation of fibro-blasts. These results indicate that honeybee silk proteins meet many prerequisites for use as a biomaterial. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of Acta Materialia Inc.

TI High-level production of poly (beta-L-malic acid) with a new isolated
   Aureobasidium pullulans strain
SO APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Poly (beta-l-malic acid) (PMLA) is a water-soluble polyester with many attractive properties in chemical industry and medicine development. However, the low titer of PMLA in the available producer strains limits further industrialization efforts and restricts its many potential applications. In order to solve this problem, a new strain with the distinguished high productivity of PMLA was isolated from fresh plants samples. It was characterized as the candidate of Aureobasidium pullulans based on the morphology and phylogenetic analyses of the internal transcribed spacer sequences. After the optimization of culture conditions, the highest PMLA concentration (62.27 g l(-1)) could be achieved in the shake flask scale. In addition, the contribution of the carbon flux to exopolysaccharide (EPS) and PMLA could be regulated by the addition of CaCO3 in the medium. This high-level fermentation process was further scaled up in the 10 l benchtop fermentor with a high PMLA concentration (57.2 g l(-1)) and productivity (0.35 g l(-1) h(-1)), which are the highest level in all the literature. Finally, the suitable acid hydrolysis conditions of PMLA were also investigated with regard to the production of l-malic acid, and the kinetics of PMLA acid hydrolysis was modeled to simulate the whole degradation process. The present work paved the road to produce this multifunctional biomaterial (PMLA) at industrial scale and promised one alternative method to produce l-malic acid in the future.

TI Care during freeze-drying of bovine pericardium tissue to be used as a
   biomaterial: A comparative study
SO CRYOBIOLOGY
AB Bovine pericardium (BP) tissue is widely used in the manufacture of bioprosthetics. The effects of freeze-drying on the BP tissue have been studied by some researchers in order to decrease their cytotoxicity due to preservation in formaldehyde solution, and to increase the lifetime of the product in storage. This study was undertaken in order to study the effect of freeze-drying in the structure of BP. To perform this study BP samples were freeze-dried in two different types of freeze-dryers available in our laboratory: a laboratory freeze-dryer, in which it was not possible to control parameters and a pilot freeze-dryer, wherein all parameters during freezing and drying were controlled. After freeze-drying processes, samples were analyzed by SEM, Raman spectroscopy, tensile strength, water uptake tests and TEM. In summary, it has been demonstrated that damages occur in collagen fibers by the loss of bulk water of collagen structure implicating in a drastic decreasing of BP mechanical properties due to its structural alterations. Moreover, it was proven that the collagen fibrils suffered breakage at some points, which can be attributed to the uncontrolled parameters during drying. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI A new alternative for bony chest wall reconstruction using biomaterial
   artificial rib and pleura: animal experiment and clinical application
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY
AB Objective: To evaluate a new method for chest wall reconstruction using porcine-derived artificial rib and pleura in an animal experiment. Further, the clinical application was performed in five patients with large defects in the chest wall as a preliminary observation. Methods: In animal experiments, a full-thickness chest wall defect of 7 cm x 8 cm was created in 12 adult mongrel dogs. Six dogs underwent reconstruction with porcine-derived artificial ribs and pleura (test group), and six with methylmethacrylate and double polyester mesh in the form of traditional Marlex sandwich technique (control group). At follow-up of each for 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, a general performance assessment and thoracic radiography were performed. Gross and histopathological examinations were carried out following humane euthanasia at the time of last follow-up. In clinical application, five patients with wide tumor resection in the chest wall underwent reconstruction with porcine-derived artificial ribs and pleura as well. Results: In animal experiment, no perioperative death or hyperpyrexia occurred and no difference in either infection or dyspnea was noted between the two groups. Postoperative radiography revealed good thoracic integrity with no evidence of collapse, deformation, or abnormal movement in the test group. In the control group, similar results were observed, except that two dogs had abnormal movement in the chest wall associated with respiration. Severe adhesions between the 'sandwich' complex and the host tissues were identified in the control group, but by contrast, only mild adhesions were noted in the test group. The non-degradable polyester mesh induced fibrous proliferation and rejection, whereas the artificial pleura was absorbed with mild fibrous hyperplasia after 12 months. In clinical application, no thoracic deformity, chronic pain, or respiratory discomfort were observed at 1 or 12 postoperative months. Conclusions: Porcine-derived ribs and pleura can be employed safely to create an artificial chest wall to repair bony chest defects. The clinical results corresponded well with those of animal experiments, and thus confirmed the safety and feasibility of this new alternative of chest wall reconstruction. However, a long-term study in a large number is needed due to the small number of animals in this study. (C) 2011 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. Published by Elsevier B. V.
