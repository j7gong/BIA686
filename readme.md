# Course BIA686: Applied Analytics in a World of Big Data.

This repository contains the source files for the project of course BIA686.

The objective is to study the topic trends in biomaterial research, especially focus on the social media features.

### Introduction and Problem Background

A biomaterial is defined as a nonviable material that is deployed in medical devices for the purpose of interacting with biological systems.[1] A great number of biomaterials have been strongly developed in many areas, such as: medicine, biology, chemistry, and materials science. With the development of social media technology, the communications among researchers have undergone great changes. Our objective is to study the emerging topics in biomaterial research and investigate how the behaviors of researchers in social media affect their scientific research. Especially, the comparison between altmetric measures and bibliometric data analysis will be presented.
